# Abstract

Paydax transforms how you access liquidity without selling your crypto, staked assets, or even real-world valuables like gold or real estate. Built on fairness and flexibility, it lets you borrow assets like USDC using your collateral, or borrow PDP tokens using USDC as collateral, all with predictable, fixed interest rates. PDP is designed to maintain value through conservative backing mechanisms and serves as the native utility token of the ecosystem, operating within established market parameters.

The more you hold and stake PDP tokens, the better your perks: potential for higher borrowing power (in future phases), fee discounts (up to 50% for large holders in Phase II), exclusive rewards, and voting rights to shape the platform's future.

A community-driven Stability Pool acts as a safety net, where users stake PDP to earn rewards by helping protect the system during liquidations.

With robust safeguards like real-time price monitoring (phased oracle strategy), defined Health Factor thresholds (target 1.0, warning at 1.1), partial liquidations (50% max), and emergency controls (circuit breakers, protocol pause), Paydax keeps your assets secure while letting you unlock liquidity.

The protocol sustains itself through a transparent revenue model based on loan origination fees (0.5%), interest spread on loans (2-3%), and liquidation penalties (5%).
