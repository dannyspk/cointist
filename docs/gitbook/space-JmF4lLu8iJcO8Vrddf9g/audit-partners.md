Audit Partners
==============

Before launching any new features or smart contracts, Paydax hires independent security experts to check the code for mistakes or weaknesses. These experts come from top blockchain audit firms, such as QuillAudits, Hacken, and Rapid Innovation, which have each reviewed hundreds of projects and helped secure billions of dollars in digital assets.

A typical audit can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on how complex the code is, and can cost anywhere from 5,000toover5,000 to over 5,000toover50,000. These audits are crucial because even a small bug in a smart contract could lead to major financial losses or security breaches. By working with trusted audit partners, Paydax helps build trust and confidence among users and investors.
