Benefits & Examples of Different Tier Thresholds
================================================

The Paydax platform uses a tier-based reward system designed to incentivize token holding and responsible borrowing. As users accumulate more PDP tokens, they ascend through predefined tiers—Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond—unlocking increasingly valuable rewards.

These incentives align individual behavior with the platform's long-term stability, scalability, and growth.

This system encourages participation through higher staking yields, reduced loan fees, better borrowing conditions, early access to features, and governance power. It also introduces structural benefits to the platform by promoting responsible borrowing, supporting liquidity stability, and driving demand for the PDP token. **Tier Benefits Overview**

Description

Targeted Incentives

Rewards scale with PDP holdings; higher tiers receive better yields, bigger discounts, and early access to opportunities

Dynamic Risk Control

Borrowing power increases only when loans remain healthy, reducing platform risk while rewarding responsible users

Stability Pool Access

Top-tier users get first access to liquidation rewards, strengthening the system's liquidity and resilience

Demand Scalability

Scarcity of top-tier status increases token demand, supporting PDP's price and driving user engagement

This tiered architecture creates a powerful feedback loop: as users seek better rewards, they acquire and stake more tokens, which drives token demand and deepens their commitment to the platform. At the same time, the system maintains risk controls and liquidity safety nets through structured privileges for responsible participants.

By combining economic incentives with stability mechanics and community governance power, the PDP tier system promotes both user growth and protocol integrity.
