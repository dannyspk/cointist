Broad Collateral Support for Unlocking Liquidity
================================================

Paydax gives users the flexibility to borrow against many different types of assets, not just popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It accepts more than 15 types of collateral. This includes both physical assets, like tokenized gold, and digital assets such as staking tokens or LP tokens from platforms like Uniswap.

This wide support means that users don't need to sell their long-term investments or rare digital assets just to access funds. Instead, they can safely lock these assets in a secure smart contract vault and borrow blue-chip cryptocurrencies without losing ownership. To keep the system safe, Paydax uses over-collateralization, which means users must deposit slightly more than they borrow.
