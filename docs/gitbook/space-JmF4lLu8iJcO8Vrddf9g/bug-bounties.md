Bug Bounties
============

To catch any hidden problems that audits might miss, Paydax runs ongoing bug bounty programs. This means anyone in the global tech community can look for bugs or security issues in the platform's code and get paid if they find something important. Some bug bounty programs in the crypto industry have paid out millions of dollars to ethical hackers who help keep platforms safe. This open approach encourages more people to check the code, making the system even more secure over time.
