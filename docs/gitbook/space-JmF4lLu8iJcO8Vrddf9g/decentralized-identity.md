Decentralized Identity
======================

In the future, we will add Decentralized Identity (DID) technology to improve security and identity verification on the platform. DID is a new system that allows people and organizations to control their own identity without needing banks or government agencies. Unlike traditional identity systems, DID uses blockchain technology to give full control to the users over their personal information.

With DID, users will create a digital identity that is verified through decentralized networks. This ensures that their identity is secure and cannot be changed without permission. This system will add an extra layer of protection and ensure that only verified and authorized users can access important features.

By using DID, we will make identity verification safer and more private. Users will have control over their information, reducing the risks of central authorities storing sensitive data. Since DID operates on a transparent and secure blockchain, it is very difficult to hack or tamper with, keeping user data safe.
