Emergency Pause Mechanism
=========================

We will add an Emergency Pause Mechanism to the platform to keep it safe. This feature will let us temporarily stop the platform from working if there's an attack or a major problem that could put your assets at risk.

This mechanism is like an emergency stop button. If something suspicious happens or if there's a risk to the platform, we can freeze key actions, like withdrawing funds or creating new loans. As a result, this helps prevent any further problems while we look into the issue.

This pause will give us time to investigate and fix the problem without risking any more damage. Once the issue is resolved, the platform will start working again, and everything will go back to normal. By adding this feature, we make sure the platform can react quickly to security threats and protect your funds.
