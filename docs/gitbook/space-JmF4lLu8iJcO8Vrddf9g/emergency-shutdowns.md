Emergency Shutdowns
===================

If a serious problem ever threatens the platform—like a major hack or a sudden market crash—Paydax has an emergency shutdown system to protect users. This system can only be activated by a vote from the community using DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance.

When triggered, the shutdown process safely stops all activity, lets users claim their share of the remaining assets, and prevents further damage. Similar systems are used by leading DeFi protocols like MakerDAO, which have successfully protected billions of dollars during past emergencies.
