    How does Paydax work?
    

**Answer** — Paydax operates through a simple, four-step process:

*   **Step 1: Deposit Collateral** — Users start by locking approved crypto assets into a secure digital vault
    
*   **Step 2: Borrow Blue-Chip Assets** — Once assets are deposited, users can borrow blue-chip cryptocurrencies like USDC, ETH, or BTC
    
*   **Step 3: Maintain Collateral Safety Score** — Users must keep their collateral safety score strong, ensuring the health of their digital vault
    
*   **Step 4: Extra Protection** — The platform utilizes a community-backed Stability Pool, adding a layer of security for all users

    What is the Collateral Safety Score?
    

**Answer** — The Collateral Safety Score is a measure of how secure your loan is:

*   A high score means your assets are safe
    
*   If the score drops too low (due to a decrease in collateral value), the system may sell some of your assets to maintain platform stability

*   **Utility Token Model:** PDP provides governance and ecosystem benefits rather than being purely speculative
    
*   **Tier-Based Benefits:** Rewards scale with token holdings and ecosystem participation

    [](#what-are-circuit-breakers-and-how-do-they-work)
    
    What are "circuit breakers" and how do they work?
    

**Answer** — Circuit breakers are an emergency control measure designed to protect the protocol during extreme market volatility. They automatically trigger if collateral prices drop rapidly or system stress reaches critical levels, which can temporarily pause certain protocol functions to prevent cascading issues and unfair liquidations.
