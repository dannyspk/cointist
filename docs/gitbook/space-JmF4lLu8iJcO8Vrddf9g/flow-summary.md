Flow Summary
============

1.  Borrower submits KYC docs
    
2.  Validator accepts job, stakes 1 PDP
    
3.  Validator checks:
    
    *   Doc clarity
        
    *   Completeness
        
    *   Matching info (across documents)
        
    
4.  Validator submits result
    
5.  AI/Compliance re-checks:
    
    *   If pass → validator earns 1 PDP
        
    *   If fail → validator loses stake
        
    
6.  Borrower proceeds to loan if KYC is approved
