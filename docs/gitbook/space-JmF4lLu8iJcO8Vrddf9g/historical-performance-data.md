Historical Performance Data
===========================

We leverage historical data analysis and machine learning models to monitor and forecast key risk indicators, including:

*   Lending and borrowing rates
    
*   Collateral price volatility
    
*   Total Value Locked (TVL)
    
*   Liquidation frequency and recovery rates
    

By analyzing past market cycles and platform performance, Paydax can identify trends, measure resilience, and optimize risk management strategies. For example, predictive models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are used to forecast interest rates and token price dynamics, providing early warning signals for potential risks.
