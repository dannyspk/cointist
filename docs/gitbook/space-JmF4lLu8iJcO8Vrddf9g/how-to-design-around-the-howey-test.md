ðŸ›¡ How to Design Around the Howey Test
======================================

To avoid classification as a security, your token should have clear, consumable utility in the ecosystem that is not driven primarily by speculative profit. Here's how your concept aligns:

Howey Criterion

Your Solution

Investment of Money

Validators stake tokens (not "invest") to participate in ID validation. Not purely passive.

Common Enterprise

Not a common enterprise if rewards are earned individually based on task accuracy.

Expectation of Profits

Validators are paid for work done, not for holding token.

Efforts of Others

Validators perform work themselves; profit is not derived solely from others.

âœ… Your token has strong utility: It acts as a work token for identity validators. They consume it by staking it to participate and earn it for doing meaningful verification work.

âš  Caveat: You must not market the token as a speculative investment. Focus marketing on ecosystem participation and functionality.
