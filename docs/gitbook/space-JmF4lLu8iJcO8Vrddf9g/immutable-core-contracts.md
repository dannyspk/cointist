Immutable Core Contracts
========================

The most important parts of Paydax's system, called core contracts, are set up so they cannot be changed after they go live. This is known as being "immutable". Once these contracts are deployed, no one (not even the developers) can alter the rules or functions inside them.

This helps in protecting users from unexpected changes or hacks and ensures that the platform operates exactly as promised. Immutable contracts are a key reason why many people trust Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms.
