Multi-Signature Wallets Using Gnosis
====================================

Paydax will improve its security by using multi-signature wallets with Gnosis Safe, a tool that helps protect user funds. Multi-signature wallets work by requiring several people to approve a transaction before it can go through. This means that no one person can move funds by themselves.

In this system, a group of trusted people (like the Paydax team, auditors, or other verified stakeholders) will share the responsibility of approving important actions. For example, before making large transactions or changing something important, a set number of approvals from these trusted individuals will be needed.

This system makes the platform much safer by lowering the chance of mistakes or bad actions by one person. It ensures that user funds are always protected and that important decisions are made carefully, with approval from multiple trusted people. This way, Paydax can better guard against potential security risks.
