Pay-Advancements Over Your Cash-Flow Tokens
===========================================

Paydax offers a smarter way to access funds without giving up ownership of your yield-generating assets. It's a lending protocol that allows you to borrow blue-chip cryptocurrencies by using a wide range of advanced and often underutilized tokens as collateral. These types of tokens usually remain idle or locked for long periods, earning passive rewards but limiting your ability to use their value elsewhere.

With Paydax, you can keep earning from these tokens while also using them to unlock liquidity. For example, if you hold stETH or aUSDC, you can borrow USDC or ETH against them without stopping your staking rewards. This approach improves capital efficiency and allows you to meet personal or financial goals (such as reinvesting or seizing new opportunities) without needing to sell or unstake your assets.
