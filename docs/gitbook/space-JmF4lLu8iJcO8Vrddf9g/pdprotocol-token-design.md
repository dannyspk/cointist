PDP Token Design
================

The PDP token serves as the native utility token within the Paydax ecosystem. It provides governance rights, staking rewards, and ecosystem benefits to holders. The token is designed to capture value through various mechanisms including fee sharing, staking rewards, and governance participation.

**Utility Functions:**

*   **Governance:** PDP holders can vote on protocol parameters, new asset additions, and system upgrades
    
*   **Staking Rewards:** Earn a share of protocol fees by staking PDP tokens
    
*   **Fee Discounts:** Higher tier holders receive reduced borrowing fees
    
*   **Liquidity Mining:** Earn PDP tokens by providing liquidity to supported pools
    

**Value Accrual:**

*   Fee revenue sharing with stakers
    
*   Buyback and burn mechanisms from protocol profits
    
*   Increased utility demand as the ecosystem grows
