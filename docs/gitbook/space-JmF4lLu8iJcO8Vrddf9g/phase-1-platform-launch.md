Phase 1 – Platform Launch
=========================

*   The platform goes live, allowing users to deposit collateral and borrow blue-chip cryptocurrencies like USDC, ETH, and BTC
    
*   Users can borrow against their collateral with fixed interest rates, making it more predictable than traditional variable rate loans
    
*   Users can stake their PDP in the Stability Pool, which helps manage risky loans and prevents cascading liquidations
    
*   Participants in the Stability Pool earn rewards for helping keep the platform secure
    
*   This phase focuses on core lending functionality and establishing the stability mechanisms
