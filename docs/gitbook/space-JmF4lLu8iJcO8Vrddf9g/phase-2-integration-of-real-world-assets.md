Phase 2 – Integration of Real-World Assets
==========================================

*   The platform adds support for Real-World Assets (RWAs) like tokenized gold, luxury goods, and real estate
    
*   These physical assets are converted into digital tokens that can be used just like cryptocurrencies
    
*   Users can now deposit digital assets (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) and real-world assets to use as collateral for loans
    
*   This expansion gives users more options to access liquidity and participate in the platform
