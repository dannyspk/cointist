Phase 3 – Full Decentralization
===============================

*   The platform becomes fully decentralized, transferring governance to the PDP token holders
    
*   Token holders can vote on key decisions, adjust policies, and shape the platform's future
    
*   This phase ensures community-driven decision-making, where anyone holding tokens can influence changes
    
*   The platform expands globally, reaching more users and growing its decentralized ecosystem
    
*   This phase supports long-term growth and sustainability of the platform
