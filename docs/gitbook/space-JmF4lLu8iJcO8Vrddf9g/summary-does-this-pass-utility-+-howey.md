✅ Summary: Does This Pass Utility + Howey?
==========================================

**Yes** — this token has a true utility in a decentralized identity validation ecosystem. It's used to access work, not just held for speculative gains. To ensure Howey compliance:

*   Avoid profit-focused marketing
    
*   Emphasize task-based participation
    
*   Ensure validators contribute active labor
    
*   Make token spending/reward central to using the DApp
