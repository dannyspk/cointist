Supported Collateral
====================

Paydax accepts a diverse range of assets as collateral. (Refer to the table in Platform Features Section II for a detailed list). This includes the native PDP token itself, major cryptocurrencies (ETH, WBTC), stablecoins (USDC, USDT), various staked assets (stETH, rETH), LP tokens from major DEXs, and tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) like gold or real estate.
