Unlocking More Value from Hard-to-Use Assets
============================================

Paydax makes it easier for users to borrow more against assets that are usually difficult to use as collateral, like LP tokens or less common staking tokens. It does this by offering competitive fixed loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, for instance, 75% LTV for borrowing USDC against blue-chip crypto collateral, and 80% LTV for borrowing blue-chip assets against PDP collateral.

The more PDP tokens you stake (in later phases), the better your borrowing conditions may become, including potential fee discounts. This system rewards active participants and gives users more control over how much value they can unlock from their holdings. By combining asset flexibility with user incentives, Paydax helps turn previously idle or locked tokens into useful financial tools.
