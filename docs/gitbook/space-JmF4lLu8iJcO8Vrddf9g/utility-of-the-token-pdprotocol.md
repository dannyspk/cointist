üß© Utility of the Token (PDP)
=============================

1.  **Staking Mechanism:** Validators stake 1 PDP to review a document set.
    
2.  ####

    Reward/Penalty:
    

*   ‚úÖ If the validator correctly approves/rejects the document quality, they earn 1 PDP.
    
*   ‚ùå If they approve bad docs (as flagged by AI/compliance), they lose their stake.
    

1.  **AI + Compliance Layer:** Second-level validation ensures validator honesty.
    

This creates a game-theoretic incentive system:

*   Honest actors win consistently
    
*   Bad actors get slashed
    
*   Token is used, not held passively

üß† AI Suggestions for Compliance Layer:

*   **OCR/ID Analysis:** Jumio, Trulioo, Onfido, or open-source AI via OpenCV + Google Vision API
    
*   **Face match** (Selfie vs. ID)
    
*   **Text verification** (addresses, names)

‚úÖ This human + AI hybrid approach makes the system robust and reduces manual errors.
