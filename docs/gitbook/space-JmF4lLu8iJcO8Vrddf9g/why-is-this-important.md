Why is this important?
======================

1.  It saves time from dodgy looking, poor scanned or photographed copies of ID going through to the next stage and waste compliance's time AND/OR the AI can't read the docs and then the user must reupload the docs again with better copies for the AI to read the docs correctly.
    
2.  It creates a natural reason WHY the ecosystem NEEDS the PDP token to exist in the ecosystem by changing hands from token holders to ID verifiers in the form of remuneration. This gives the token utility and passes the SEC's Howey test.
    
3.  It encourages investors to hold token due to natural demand for the token due to it being remunerated to ID verifiers
    
4.  ID Verifiers are penalized for not operating in alignment to the ID verification framework and risk losing their collateral due to bad acting protecting the integrity of the Token's ecosystem
    
5.  Instead of relying on third-party software to do the ID checks (which will be done in the immediate beginning) it will become proprietary in-house software and relies wholly on the ecosystem to verify IDs
    
6.  Lastly, instead of users earning by mining on their iPhones they can verify docs on their iPhone while they're on the go travelling on a subway earning remuneration by verifying IDs creating another sales angle of WHY this is a great product/ecosystem to be a part of. Coupled with the AI narrative for checking Docs against Gov records before loans are issued when docs have been uploaded correctly and checked by the ID Verification Operator
