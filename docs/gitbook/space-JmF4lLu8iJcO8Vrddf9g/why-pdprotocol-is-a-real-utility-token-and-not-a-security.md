Why PDP is a REAL utility Token and NOT a security
==================================================

PDP has ID verification operators that will check the ID's of borrowers which are looking to borrow money in part of the KYC process before loans are issued.

The loan operator will use the PDP framework (Check Passport, Driver's License and utility bill or bank statement dated in the past 3 months) to verify ID by ensuring the ID + Proof of Address has been uploaded correctly to the database/smart contract and its clear and presents itself well enough to be accepted by compliance before using AI to check these docs against Government official registers for approval.

Once this process has been successfully completed, the ID Verification Operator will be remunerated in PDP tokens. If the ID Verification Operator don't successfully certify the ID+POA docs are of proper standing and the AI can't read the docs due to this reason, the ID Verification Operator is not remunerated PDP tokens for its efforts and loses all of the collateral provided to verify the docs. This creates an organic integrity in the ecosystem removing any bad actors not verifying docs correctly.
