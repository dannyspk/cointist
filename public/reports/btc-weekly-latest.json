      "Early week: multiple rejections at the 116k–118k supply zone; bullish momentum cooled.",
      "Midweek: a rapid liquidity sweep down to ~107k–109k (stop hunt) with elevated sell volume.",
      "Post‑sweep: a bounce/retest into the 111k–114k gap area (partial fill) but sellers remained active around 116k.",
      "Current: lower highs and weak confirmation on the bounce; watch the reaction at the gap and the 109k demand band."

      "Momentum: RSI softened from overbought to neutral/weak; no clear bullish divergence on the bounce.",

      "Volume: heavy selling on the sweep; muted volume on the bounce indicates limited conviction.",
