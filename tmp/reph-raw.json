          "text": "<h2>Gold reaches new peak above $3,740 as 2025 rally intensifies</h2>\n<p>Gold climbed above $3,740 on Monday, setting a fresh record as the metal's 2025 rally accelerated. The move follows sustained buying by central banks and growing safe-haven demand, leaving gold more than 40% higher year-to-date.</p>\n\n<article>\n  <p>Gold’s advance past $3,740 marks a striking acceleration in 2025, extending gains that have already pushed the metal more than 40% year-to-date. Market participants point to a combination of persistent inflationary pressure and geopolitical uncertainty that has increased demand for non-yielding assets. Prices have been further supported by strong physical buying and speculative momentum in futures and exchange-traded products.</p>\n\n  <h3>Drivers of the rally</h3>\n  <p>Central bank purchases, including notable buying by China, have been a key pillar of demand, with official sector accumulation tightening available global supply. At the same time, investors seeking protection from currency devaluation have turned to gold amid a weakening US dollar and elevated inflation expectations. Safe-haven flows during bouts of market volatility have compounded these effects, reinforcing the metal’s role as an alternative store of value.</p>\n\n  <h3>Analyst outlook</h3>\n  <p>Major banks are increasingly bullish on the metal’s trajectory, with Goldman Sachs and UBS projecting a path toward $3,800 to $4,000 by late 2025 or into 2026. Those forecasts reflect scenarios in which inflation remains sticky, central bank policy diverges, or geopolitical risks elevate flight-to-safety buying. Analysts caution, however, that momentum-driven rallies can be punctuated by periods of consolidation if macro data or policy expectations shift.</p>\n\n  <h3>Historical context and implications</h3>\n  <p>The latest record comes after a prior milestone when gold surpassed the $2,000 barrier in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period that similarly saw investors seeking protection from economic shock. The current advance, significantly larger in percentage terms, underscores how perceptions of gold’s utility have evolved amid renewed concerns over fiat currency stability. For investors and policymakers, the rally raises questions about portfolio hedging strategies, central bank reserves, and the potential for further capital flows into precious metals.</p>\n\n  <p>Looking ahead, market attention will focus on inflation readings, US dollar movements, and any further central bank buying that could sustain momentum. While price targets from major banks suggest upside, the path will likely be shaped by incoming economic data and shifts in global monetary policy. For now, gold’s new peak reflects a confluence of factors that have reasserted its traditional role as a hedge in uncertain times.</p>\n</article>"
