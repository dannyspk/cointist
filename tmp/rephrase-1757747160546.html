<article>
  <h3>Recent Price Movements</h3>

  <h3>Astronomer's Analysis</h3>
  <p>Independent analyst Astronomer argues there is a "90%+" probability that the recent low is indeed a definitive bottom. He utilizes his “FOMC reversal confluence” framework to support this claim.</p>
  
  <h3>Shift in Sentiment</h3>
  <p>Previously, Astronomer had predicted a decline towards the $110,000-$111,000 range but has since adopted a more optimistic outlook. His analysis stands in stark contrast to the more bearish sentiment expressed by numerous crypto influencers.</p>

  <h3>Upcoming FOMC Meeting</h3>

  <h3>Market Dynamics and Trends</h3>

  <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
  <p>As Bitcoin stabilizes above the $115,000 mark, market participants are eager for confirmation of a lasting bottom. All eyes are on the FOMC meeting as it approaches, with potential implications for the cryptocurrency's future price movements.</p>
