    <h3>Clear Rules for Digital Assets</h3>
    <p>During a speech in Paris, Paul Atkins underscored the necessity for well-defined regulations surrounding digital assets. He articulated a vision that supports the growth of the crypto industry by providing clarity for various stakeholders.</p>

    <h3>Project Crypto Overview</h3>
    <p>Atkins introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to modernize the regulatory landscape for various digital asset classes, specifically targeting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tokens</li>
        <li>Lending platforms</li>
        <li>Staking services</li>
        <li>Trading venues</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classification of Tokens</h3>
    <p>One of the significant outcomes of this initiative is the classification of most tokens as non-securities. This decision is expected to alleviate legal uncertainties for entrepreneurs in the digital asset space.</p>

    <h3>Integrated Regulatory Approach</h3>
    <p>Atkins proposed that trading, lending, and staking could operate under a unified regulatory framework. This integration aims to streamline compliance and enhance operational efficiency for market participants.</p>

    <h3>Facilitating Tokenized Securities</h3>
    <p>The initiative also seeks to promote the development of tokenized securities and decentralized finance (DeFi) software, paving the way for innovative financial solutions within the market.</p>

    <h3>Impact of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <p>Atkins mentioned the rising influence of artificial intelligence on financial markets, coining the term "agentic finance." This concept refers to the potential transformation AI could bring to how financial transactions and services are executed.</p>

    <h3>Balancing Innovation and Protection</h3>
    <p>Emphasizing the importance of both innovation and investor protection, Atkins concluded that finding a harmonious balance is crucial for the future viability of U.S. financial markets.</p>
