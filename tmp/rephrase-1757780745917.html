    <h3>Shifting the Narrative</h3>
    <p>While discussions about AI often highlight potential job displacement, the core issue is the surrounding systems that support its deployment.</p>

    <h3>Limitations of Current Models</h3>
    <p>Many contemporary AI frameworks are efficiency-oriented, which can neglect crucial elements such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adaptability</li>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Human development</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Promise of Human-Centered AI</h3>
    <p>By centering our AI strategies around human needs, organizations can foster:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transformative work environments</li>
        <li>Collaboration between humans and machines</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Role of Policy</h3>
    <p>Merely implementing policies is insufficient. To truly advance, we must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on systems that enhance human adaptability</li>
        <li>Integrate technological progress with a human-centric approach</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ethical Considerations in AI</h3>
    <p>Ethical AI should prioritize dignity and the enhancement of human potential. This means moving beyond simple performance optimization to a more holistic approach that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Respects individual rights</li>
        <li>Encourages personal growth</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Modular Approach to Integration</h3>
    <p>Adopting a modular strategy for AI development can yield significant benefits, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Incorporating human data effectively</li>
        <li>Delivering tailored support to users</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Envisioning the Future of Work</h3>
    <p>The future workplace will be determined by those who strategically use AI to empower individuals, rather than simply treating them as output generators. By making human-centric systems a priority, we can ensure a more innovative and inclusive future.</p>
