    <h3>Overview of DeFi Market</h3>
    <p>The DeFi market has experienced remarkable growth over the past few years, driven by innovations in blockchain technology and a shift towards decentralized financial services. This evolution has allowed users to engage in various financial activities without intermediaries, thereby democratizing access to financial products. As of now, the total value locked in DeFi protocols stands at an impressive $160 billion, highlighting the sector's increasing importance in the global financial landscape.</p>

    <h3>Dominance of Major Protocols</h3>
    <p>Despite the substantial growth of the DeFi market, the distribution of capital within it raises concerns. A significant portion of the TVL is concentrated in a few dominant protocols, which poses risks to the overall ecosystem. This concentration can lead to vulnerabilities, as any adverse developments affecting these major players could have cascading effects throughout the market, potentially jeopardizing the investments of smaller participants.</p>

    <h3>Future Trends in DeFi</h3>
    <p>Looking ahead, the DeFi landscape is likely to evolve with increased regulatory scrutiny and the emergence of new protocols aiming to reduce concentration risks. Innovations in governance models and liquidity provision may promote a more equitable distribution of capital across the ecosystem. As the sector matures, stakeholders are expected to prioritize resilience and inclusivity, ensuring that the benefits of DeFi can be realized by a broader audience while mitigating the inherent risks associated with capital concentration.</p>
