  <p>Ripple set out an infrastructure-first roadmap for $RLUSD alongside privacy plans for the XRP Ledger, underscoring a cross-network approach designed to meet institutional and developer needs. The company framed the effort against a rapidly expanding market, with the stablecoin sector now at $302 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

  <h3>Infrastructure first: interoperability, transparency and scale</h3>
  <p>Ripple positioned interoperability, transparency and scale as the foundational pillars for $RLUSD, prioritizing technical breadth over brand exclusivity. Jack McDonald emphasized cross-network design over brand lock-in, signaling that the stablecoinâ€™s utility will hinge on seamless movement across multiple ecosystems.</p>

  <h3>RLUSD transparency and issuance</h3>
  <p>Ripple said $RLUSD will emphasize transparency through monthly reserve reports and enterprise-grade backing intended to support predictable liquidity and risk management. The reporting cadence is aimed at giving market participants regular insight into reserves and operations.</p>
  <p>Issuance on XRP Ledger and Ethereum is planned to extend reach and minimize fragmentation, aligning with the interoperability-first stance. By supporting both networks, Ripple aims to meet users where activity already resides while preserving optionality for future integrations.</p>

  <h3>XRP Ledger privacy roadmap</h3>
  <p>RippleX targets Confidential MPT for XRP Ledger privacy with EC-ElGamal and ZKPs, preserving XLS-33 and auditability. The approach is designed to introduce privacy at the protocol level while maintaining verifiability, allowing participants to protect sensitive transaction details without sacrificing oversight.</p>
  <p>By coupling cryptographic safeguards with standards compatibility, RippleX seeks to balance confidentiality with operational transparency. The initiative complements the broader $RLUSD pillars, positioning privacy as a feature that supports scale and cross-network usability rather than constraining it.</p>
