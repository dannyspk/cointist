  <p>Momentum in Ethereum strengthened after the Fed’s 25bps cut coincided with renewed large-wallet activity and firmer derivatives positioning. An OTC whale bought 25,000 ETH for $112.34M USDC at $4,493, a sizable print that reinforced accumulating flows. At the same time, exchange outflows hit $86.17M on September 18, pointing to rising self-custody and a tighter CEX float.</p>

  <h3>Whale accumulation follows Fed move</h3>
  <p>The Fed’s 25bps cut signaled easier financial conditions and appears to have catalyzed fresh spot demand. The standout was an OTC purchase of 25,000 ETH for $112.34M USDC at $4,493, a transaction size consistent with institutional or high-net-worth accumulation. While one block buy doesn’t set a trend, it aligns with a broader bid for risk assets following policy easing.</p>

  <h3>Outflows thin CEX supply as profit-taking risk rises</h3>
  <p>Exchange outflows hitting $86.17M on September 18 suggest more ETH migrating to self-custody and a corresponding reduction in immediately sellable supply on centralized venues. Historically, such outflows can support price by tightening available inventory, particularly when demand improves. However, mid-sized whales holding 10K–100K ETH are near November 2021 profit levels, elevating profit-taking risk and the possibility of supply returning on strength.</p>

  <h3>Leverage tilts long; outlook hinges on flows and discipline</h3>
  <p>On Binance, positioning skews bullish at 64.95% long vs 35.05% short (Long/Short Ratio 1.85), underscoring a speculative bias toward upside. Elevated leverage can accelerate gains if spot demand persists but also heightens the risk of sharp liquidations if momentum fades.</p>
  <p>Whether Ethereum can sustain its advance will likely depend on continued accumulation, ongoing exchange outflows, and a gradual normalization of leverage rather than an overheated build-up. A supportive flow backdrop could extend the move, but with 10K–100K ETH cohorts near November 2021 profit levels, any rally may encounter intermittent supply as investors lock in gains.</p>
