  <h3>Launch timeline and backers</h3>
  <p>Plasma said it will go live Thursday, Sept. 25 at 8:00 am ET with a Mainnet Beta that also marks the debut of XPL. The initiative is backed by Bitfinex and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and arrives with $2 billion liquidity and 100+ DeFi partners, including Aave, Ethena, Fluid, and Euler.</p>
  <p>The network’s partner roster positions Plasma for immediate liquidity and integrations at launch, aiming to accelerate user adoption from day one. The company frames the rollout as part of a broader push to meet growing demand for stablecoin rails and capital-efficient market access.</p>

  <h3>Design, markets and user features</h3>
  <p>Plasma is an EVM L1 with a Bitcoin bridge, designed to connect crypto liquidity while maintaining Ethereum compatibility. Its stated goal is to deliver “savings that preserve value” and support deep USDT markets, aligning the chain’s design with day-to-day transactional and treasury use cases.</p>
  <p>At launch, users can make bridge vault deposits, process USD₮0 withdrawals, and send zero-fee USDT transfers. These features are intended to reduce friction for stablecoin flows while giving depositors straightforward on- and off-ramps that tie into existing market venues.</p>

  <h3>Token distribution and early demand signals</h3>
  <p>Plasma plans an initial XPL allocation that sends 25 million to depositors and 2.5 million for Stablecoin Collective, with U.S. tokens in July 2026. The distribution is structured to reward early liquidity provision while reserving a dedicated tranche for ecosystem initiatives.</p>
  <p>Interest in the platform has been fueled by early activity, including a $1 billion vault filled in 30 minutes and $373 million in additional commitments. Signals from adjacent markets—such as Maple’s syrupUSDT and commentary from Zaheer Ebtikar—underscore the momentum behind stablecoin demand that Plasma aims to capture.</p>
