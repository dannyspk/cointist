  <p>HYPE extended its rally to $58.77 after a $57.40 high, bringing the $60 psychological level into play amid brisk spot and derivatives activity. The move follows a string of ecosystem upgrades on Hyperliquid and eye-catching fee traction, even as short-term technicals flag mounting risks.</p>

  <h3>Upgrades and adoption expand liquidity</h3>
  <p>USDC and Circle’s CCTP V2 are now live on Hyperliquid’s EVM, a step designed to streamline native USDC portability and deepen liquidity across HyperCore/HyperEVM and DeFi deposits. The integration underpins a broader push to reduce frictions for cross-chain capital, positioning Hyperliquid to capture flows from users prioritizing fast settlement and composability.</p>
  <p>Fundamentals have accelerated alongside adoption, with $2.5 million in daily fees (surpassing Ethereum and Solana) highlighting robust on-chain activity. In Q3, fees totaled $250.45 million, with $243.59 million to holders, while a lean team of 11 continues to layer in staking incentives, new listings, and institutional interest to extend reach and depth of market.</p>

  <h3>Technical picture: wedge risk into resistance</h3>
  <p>On the two-hour chart, price is tracing a rising wedge focused around $59.36, a level that now serves as the immediate pivot for trend continuation. The RSI sits near overbought with signs of bearish divergence, suggesting momentum may be stretched as the market grapples with overhead supply near $60.</p>
  <p>If the wedge resolves lower, initial pullback targets emerge at $55, followed by $52–$48 on a deeper reset. Conversely, a bullish engulfing through resistance could reclaim $60 and open a path toward $70 per Polymarket, provided bids sustain above $59.36 to invalidate the divergence.</p>

  <h3>Outlook and key level</h3>
  <p>With liquidity upgrades and record fee prints providing a strong fundamental backdrop, $59.36 stands as the line in the sand for sustained momentum. Holding that level would keep the focus on $60 and higher, while failure to do so increases the probability of a drift toward $55 and the $52–$48 demand region.</p>
