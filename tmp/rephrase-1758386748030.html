  <h3>Strategy’s stake and the company identity</h3>
  <p>At the center of Saylor’s blueprint is Strategy’s 638,500 BTC stake, a position presented as more than an investment and instead as a defining element of corporate identity and strategy. That accumulation, driven by a 2020 buying pivot, has reshaped how the company reports assets and speaks to investors, with the Bitcoin holding frequently foregrounded in public communications. The concentration of digital assets informs both capital allocation decisions and the firm’s market narrative in ways that diverge from conventional corporate profiles.</p>

  <h3>Forecasting outperformance: the 29%/21-year claim</h3>
  <p>Saylor and proponents frame Bitcoin as capable of sustained excess returns versus equities, often summarized in comparisons of Bitcoin “forever” to the S&P 500 and the repeated invocation of the 29%/21-year claim. Presented as a long-range expectation rather than a guaranteed outcome, the claim underpins Strategy’s thesis that allocating corporate treasury to Bitcoin will outperform holding cash or owning traditional index exposures. Critics note that translating a historical or projected annualized figure into future corporate performance involves significant assumptions about market structure and macro conditions.</p>

  <h3>Bitcoin as digital capital and the case for lending</h3>
  <p>The blueprint advances a conceptual shift: treating Bitcoin as “digital capital” that can back loans and underpin credit instruments, thereby integrating it into corporate finance and banking functions. Proponents argue this would create new utility for Bitcoin beyond price appreciation, enabling balance-sheet uses similar to other collateralized assets. Yet the proposals confront material hurdles, including price volatility that complicates margining, regulatory uncertainty across jurisdictions and limited real-world market tests of Bitcoin as primary collateral.</p>

  <p>Those accounting and market realities also help explain why Strategy is not included in the S&P 500. Fair value accounting for volatile crypto holdings and periodic impairments can suppress reported profitability metrics that index inclusion criteria require, and the 2020 buying pivot concentrated the company’s economic exposure in a way index committees have historically treated cautiously. With BTCUSD trading at $115,809, the debate over whether Bitcoin can serve both as a store of value and a functional element of corporate finance remains active among investors, regulators and accounting standard-setters.</p>
