<p>Since 2017, projects have distributed roughly $20 billion in airdrops, with $4.5 billion alone in 2023, according to industry tallies. That level of spending has succeeded at one thing reliably: attracting rapid attention and temporary user engagement. But the surge in users and transactions often proves ephemeral, forcing investors and builders to question the long-term return on those distributions.</p>

<h3>Scale and short-term spikes</h3>
<p>The immediate effects of high-profile airdrops can be dramatic. Arbitrum, for example, saw as many as 2.5 million daily transactions after its distribution, while Blur captured roughly 70% of NFT trading share during its airdrop-driven phase. These peaks have proven useful for signaling network vitality and drawing media attention, yet they tell an incomplete story about sustained activity.</p>

<p>Data from DappRadar illustrates the decay that follows many drops: activity frequently retreats to something like 20-40% above baseline after the initial spike, and about 88% lose value within three months. That pattern suggests most recipients either flip tokens quickly or return to prior behavior levels, leaving projects with fleeting boosts rather than persistent communities. The metrics raise questions about whether airdrops primarily reward speculators rather than long-term builders and users.</p>

<h3>Critiques and project responses</h3>
<p>Voices in the crypto community have suggested changes to improve outcomes. Haseeb Qureshi and teams such as Dragonfly Capital have advocated for mechanisms to align incentives more effectively, and proposals like a "Holder Score" aim to measure and reward sustained engagement rather than momentary participation. These ideas seek to reduce churn by prioritizing long-term holders and meaningful contributions over airdrop-driven churn.</p>

<p>Some projects are experimenting with alternative approaches and follow-up incentives. Jesse Pollak has commented publicly on the limitations of simple airdrops, and Coinbase’s Base has explored structured distributions to encourage ongoing use. Other experiments include Linea’s token drop, which fell by more than 50% after distribution, and Joseph Lubin’s announcement of extra rewards intended to shore up continued participation and offset price declines.</p>

<p>The overall lesson for builders and investors is that airdrops remain a blunt but powerful tool: effective at creating short-term velocity, less reliable at building long-term ecosystems. Moving forward, projects that combine well-measured distribution mechanics, follow-on incentives, and metrics for sustained engagement will be better positioned to convert initial interest into durable value. If the industry wants airdrops to do more than create headlines, the emphasis will have to shift from sheer scale to smarter design. </p>
