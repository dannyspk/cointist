<p>HashKey Capital CEO Deng Chao has outlined a framework intended to make corporate crypto treasuries more durable and operationally sound, centring on clear governance, stringent risk discipline and the maintenance of strategic reserves. The approach accompanies the launch of HashKey’s $500 million DAT fund in Hong Kong, which the firm presents as both an investment vehicle and a blueprint for how corporates might hold digital assets without compromising balance-sheet integrity. Deng frames the effort as a response to institutional concerns about custody, liquidity and regulatory clarity, aiming to reduce operational frictions that have historically deterred large-scale corporate participation.</p>

<h3>Fund launch and design</h3>
<p>The $500 million DAT fund will offer exposure to BTC and ETH while incorporating subscription and redemption mechanisms designed to manage liquidity and market impact. HashKey has emphasized solutions to balance daily investor flows against the underlying liquidity of BTC and ETH markets, seeking to avoid forced trades during periods of stress and to provide orderly access for investors. The fund’s operating model includes liquidity buffers and redemption gates calibrated to protect remaining investors, though HashKey frames these as pragmatic tools rather than permanent constraints.</p>

<p>Operationally, the DAT fund pairs onchain holdings with offchain liquidity arrangements to facilitate subscriptions and redemptions, and it leverages market-making and custody partnerships to smooth execution. HashKey has signalled an intent to combine institutional custody standards with active liquidity management so that token exposure can be delivered without compromising security or imposing outsized slippage on large flows. The design balances passive crypto exposure with the practicalities of running a pooled vehicle for corporate and institutional clients.</p>

<h3>Governance, deployment priorities and strategic reserves</h3>
<p>Deng Chao places governance and discipline at the centre of HashKey’s treasury framework, arguing that clear decision rights, reporting lines and contingency plans are essential for corporate adoption. The firm explicitly prioritizes custody and payments infrastructure, staking services and regulated stablecoin rails as first-order deployment areas where corporate treasuries can extract operational value while preserving capital. Maintaining strategic reserves—liquid holdings set aside for payments or margin—forms a core tenet of the framework, intended to keep firms operational during market dislocations without forcing asset sales.</p>

<p>HashKey’s approach further stresses the importance of regulated stablecoin infrastructure for day-to-day corporate activity, and of staking and custody services that meet institutional compliance and audit requirements. By focusing on these building blocks, the firm seeks to make onchain capabilities accessible to treasury teams that are otherwise wary of the technical and regulatory complexity of digital assets. This creates a pathway for corporates to capture efficiencies from crypto-enabled payments and settlements while adhering to conservative treasury practices.</p>

<h3>Market context and institutional barriers</h3>
<p>HashKey positions its fund against a broader market backdrop in which large-scale crypto holdings are increasingly visible but still concentration-heavy: SoSoValue and BitcoinTreasuries.NET report $152.31 billion in reported holdings, equivalent to 6.63% of supply, and 1,111,225 Bitcoin valued at $128 billion. Those figures underscore both demand for long-duration BTC exposure and the concentration of holdings among a subset of institutions and treasuries, highlighting liquidity and custody considerations for any new entrants. HashKey argues that a robust treasury model must account for those market realities through liquidity buffers, managed redemptions and careful counterparty selection.</p>

<p>Despite growing interest, institutional barriers remain significant: regulatory uncertainty, operational integration, custodial risk and internal governance hurdles continue to slow adoption. HashKey anticipates that the push toward RWA tokenization, expanded OTC markets and onchain product development will help lower these barriers by creating more familiar, regulated pathways for institutions to source liquidity and to underwrite exposures. The firm sees progress on tokenized real-world assets, improved OTC protocols and compliant onchain instruments as complementary trends that will enable broader corporate participation in crypto treasuries over time.</p>

<p>In sum, HashKey’s framework and the new $500 million DAT fund represent a concerted effort to translate lessons from early adopters into a repeatable model for corporate treasuries. By foregrounding governance, liquidity management and regulated infrastructure, the firm is betting that institutional treasuries can access BTC and ETH exposure without sacrificing the controls and resiliency required by corporate balance sheets. Whether that model scales will depend on continued progress in custody standards, market liquidity and regulatory clarity.</p>
