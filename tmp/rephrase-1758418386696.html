  <h3>S-1 filing and recent financial performance</h3>
  <p>BitGo’s S-1 filing confirms its intention to pursue a listing on the NYSE under the ticker BTGO, marking a major step toward a public debut. In H1 2025 the company reported $4.19 billion in revenue and net income $12.6 million, figures disclosed in the filing as part of its push to go public.</p>
  <p>The filing also provides year-over-year context by disclosing 2024 financials: $3.08 billion revenue; $156.6 million net income; $54.1 million to common stockholders. Those 2024 figures highlight the scale of BitGo’s business as the company moves from private to public markets and frames the H1 2025 results for investors evaluating the offering.</p>

  <h3>Business profile, scale and governance</h3>
  <p>BitGo is based in Palo Alto and was founded in 2013; the company reports $90 billion in Assets on Platform and 1.14 million users, metrics that underpin its custody and infrastructure business. The S-1 notes a concentration in Bitcoin, Sui, Solana, XRP, Ethereum (AoP as of June 30, 2025), reflecting the tokens that make up the largest shares of assets the company services.</p>
  <p>The company maintains a dual-class share structure in which Class B shares carry 15 votes per share versus one vote for Class A shares, and CEO Mike Belshe retains control under that arrangement. The governance structure is set out in the filing and will be a key consideration for investors assessing control and voting dynamics after the listing.</p>

  <h3>Planned use of proceeds and market context</h3>
  <p>In the S-1 BitGo outlines planned uses of IPO proceeds and strategic priorities intended to support growth initiatives, product development and potential expansion of its services, although the filing does not assign specific dollar amounts to each objective. The company says the capital raise will underpin efforts to scale its platform and deepen its market position as it enters public markets.</p>
  <p>BitGo’s move comes amid broader activity in the crypto infrastructure and services sector, where firms such as Circle, Gemini, and Bullish operate as peers or adjacent competitors in custody, trading and other digital-asset services. The S-1 frames BitGo’s proposed listing as part of a larger market shift toward greater institutionalization and public-market access for crypto-native businesses.</p>
