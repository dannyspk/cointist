  <p>Buterin’s thesis frames low-risk DeFi as the analog of a commercial backbone in the way Google became a backbone for the consumer web: essential infrastructure that reliably supports vast downstream economic activity. The comparison highlights a distinction between headline-grabbing experiments and the slow accretion of utility that produces durable commercial value. By emphasizing stability and predictable utility, the argument invites builders and users to prioritize primitives that scale trust and everyday usage over transient speculation.</p>

  <h3>DeFi maturation and concentrated losses</h3>
  <p>The maturation of DeFi has been uneven, with much innovation occurring at the experimental edges where concentrated losses have frequently materialized. Those painful episodes have clarified which components are inherently high-risk and which can be engineered for steady use. The result is a renewed focus on primitives that minimize systemic exposure while still enabling programmable finance across payments, savings and credit.</p>

  <h3>Core low-risk primitives and how they differ from past yield farming</h3>
  <p>At the center of Buterin’s view are core low-risk primitives: payments, savings, stablecoin deposits and collateralized lending (Aave). These services mirror traditional financial rails in purpose but add programmability and composability, enabling new product designs without relying on outsized, artificial returns. The emphasis on stablecoin deposits and collateralized lending recognizes platforms like Aave as central infrastructure for on-chain credit and liquidity provisioning.</p>

  <p>Low-risk DeFi differs from past yield farming in motive and mechanism: where yield farming sought to attract capital through temporary, often protocol-driven rewards, low-risk primitives compete on access, reliability and genuine utility. Rather than minting token incentives to manufacture yield, the sustainable model is to deliver services people and businesses want to use, capturing value through fees, settlement flows and integration. That shift changes the incentives for protocol governance, product design and user adoption, favoring durable revenue over short-term attraction.</p>

  <h3>Future pathways and implications for ETH revenue and growth</h3>
  <p>Looking ahead, Buterin outlines several development pathways that could extend low-risk DeFi’s reach: reputation-based undercollateralized lending, prediction markets, basket currencies, CPI "flatcoins" and personal tokens. Each pathway addresses gaps in current markets—credit intermediation without full collateralization, diversified unit-of-account mechanisms, and more expressive identity- and reputation-based financial services—while posing new technical and regulatory questions. Progress on these fronts would expand the set of low-risk, high-utility primitives that can undergird commerce on Ethereum.</p>

  <p>Cultural alignment is as important as technical progress: for low-risk DeFi to become a commercial backbone, developers, investors and users must prioritize composability, interoperability and conservative risk design. If achieved, the shift could produce steadier ETH-denominated revenue streams and deeper network effects, reinforcing Ethereum’s role as a platform for productive economic activity rather than a venue dominated by speculative yield experiments. Buterin’s thesis thus reframes success as the accumulation of reliable, widely used financial rails rather than episodic protocol fads.</p>
