  <h3>Why I need the source text</h3>
  <p>I do not have the ability to access or browse external web links, so I cannot retrieve material from URLs you provide. To ensure accuracy and to preserve the precise wording of named entities and numeric facts, please paste the full article text or the key paragraphs and facts directly into the message. Supplying the source text lets me work from the same material you expect me to summarize, re-title, or reformat.</p>

  <h3>What I will produce</h3>
  <p>After you paste the text, I will create a publication-ready output that includes a new H2 title and a concise outline of 4–6 headings, retaining every named entity and numeric fact exactly as given. If you ask, I can also convert that outline into a complete article formatted with an excerpt and an article body that follows the HTML structure you prefer. I will follow your requirements for heading count, paragraph length, and editorial tone when preparing the final draft.</p>

  <h3>How to prepare and send the text</h3>
  <p>Paste the complete article or the most important paragraphs and bullet points, and include any bylines, dates, source names, or figures you want preserved verbatim. If there are multiple versions, indicate which one to use and call out any sensitive or disputed facts that require special handling. Once you supply the text, I will respond with the new H2 title, the 4–6 heading outline, and—if requested—a polished HTML article that meets your formatting and editorial constraints.</p>
