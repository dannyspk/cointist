Chainlink (LINK), one of the crypto market’s leading providers of decentralized oracle solutions, has announced a partnership with the prediction market platform Polymarket. Polymarket Integrates Chainlink On Polygon According to Friday’s announcement, the new integration is now live on the Polygon (POL) mainnet, enabling Polymarket to establish secure and real-time prediction markets centered around asset pricing, including numerous active cryptocurrency trading pairs. This collaboration also explores new methodologies to address more subjective questions. By doing so, Polymarket seeks to reduce its dependence on social voting mechanisms, thereby mitigating resolution risks in its markets. var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6); var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd; var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER'; document.write('<scr'+'ipt src="'+absrc+'" type="text/javascript"></scr'+'ipt>'); if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement("script"); s.async = true; s.type = "text/javascript";s.src = "https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js";var n = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || []; var abkw = window.abkw || ""; var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0; (function(){ var divs = document.querySelectorAll(".plc366606:not([id])"); var div = divs[divs.length-1]; div.id = "placement_366606_"+plc366606; AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], "placement_366606_"+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: "servedbyadbutler.com", click:"CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER" }}); })(); Related Reading Bitcoin Crawls Up On Weak Supply: 30D Momentum Reveals It Lacks Real Demand 14 hours ago The integration combines Chainlink Data Streams, which deliver low-latency, timestamped, and verifiable oracle reports, with Chainlink Automation, ensuring timely and automated on-chain market settlements. This infrastructure reportedly allows for swift resolution of any asset pricing predictions, such as Bitcoin (BTC) price forecasts, based on predetermined parameters. Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink, commented on the partnership, stating that Polymarket’s decision to integrate Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure is a “pivotal milestone” that transforms the creation and settlement of prediction markets. var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6); var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd; var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER'; document.write('<scr'+'ipt src="'+absrc+'" type="text/javascript"></scr'+'ipt>'); if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement("script"); s.async = true; s.type = "text/javascript";s.src = "https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js";var n = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || []; var abkw = window.abkw || ""; var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0; (function(){ var divs = document.querySelectorAll(".plc452518:not([id])"); var div = divs[divs.length-1]; div.id = "placement_452518_"+plc452518; AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], "placement_452518_"+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: "servedbyadbutler.com", click:"CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER" }}); })(); He emphasized that when outcomes are determined by high-quality data and tamper-proof computation, prediction markets evolve into reliable signals that can be trusted globally. This partnership is viewed as a significant advancement toward a future grounded in cryptographic truth. $100 Billion In DeFi Value Chainlink has established itself as a leading data infrastructure provider, securing nearly $100 billion in total value across various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and facilitating transactions worth tens of trillions. The protocol’s reliability stems from its decentralized network of independent node operators, which ensures that applications function seamlessly without single points of failure. var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6); var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd; var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER'; document.write('<scr'+'ipt src="'+absrc+'" type="text/javascript"></scr'+'ipt>'); if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement("script"); s.async = true; s.type = "text/javascript";s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';var n = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || []; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var plc452519 = window.plc452519 || 0; (function(){ var divs = document.querySelectorAll(".plc452519:not([id])"); var div = divs[divs.length-1]; div.id = "placement_452519_"+plc452519; AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452519, [728,90], 'placement_452519_'+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452519++, keywords: abkw, domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com', click:'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER' }}); })(); Polymarket, on the other hand, launched in 2020, has rapidly grown into a source for real-time information. Its recent acquisition of QCEX, a CFTC-licensed exchange and clearinghouse for $112 million, highlights its goal to re-entering the US market. Additionally, Polymarket has partnered with X (formerly Twitter) to offer integrated products that provide users with data-driven insights and personalized market recommendations.
