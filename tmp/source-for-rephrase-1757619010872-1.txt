Bitcoin Korean traders pull back from Bitcoin as KOSPI hits new highs! 2min Read Korean investors could play a key role in Bitcoin’s move.

Indicators point to accumulation in the broader market, even as Korean investors reduce their exposure. Bitcoin [BTC] in the past day continued to post modest gains, rising by 1.43% as the asset reclaimed $113,890, at press time. This leaves Bitcoin at least $10,000 away from reaching its all-time high. AMBCrypto’s analysis notes that for such a major surge to occur, there is an emerging pattern in the Korean market that could play a decisive role. KOSPI market has a role The Korean KOSPI Composite Index, which tracks the performance of top Korean companies within the stock market, has climbed to a new all-time high. Alphractal data shows that this level was last reached in 2021, a sign that the Korean market remains strong and is currently thriving.

In 2021, when KOSPI hit a record high, Bitcoin was also trading close to its all-time high. If a similar situation unfolds now, it could mean Bitcoin is approaching a peak before entering a phase of price declines. Korean investors’ position Korean investors have been scaling back their exposure to Bitcoin, although they remain actively involved in buying the asset. This trend was measured through the Korean Premium Index, a metric that tracks whether these investors are buying or selling Bitcoin. At press time, the metric read 0.2 above the zero level that indicates selling activity.

Even with this trend, accumulation across the broader market remains strong. The Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) index continues to point toward net accumulation, with the total trading volume at 173,000.

On the verge of a breakout move Analysis of Bitcoin’s 1-day chart shows that the asset is now trading into a key resistance level. Historically, Bitcoin tends to break through these types of patterns after multiple retests, often leading to sharp upward moves. In this case, Bitcoin is attempting once again to breach this resistance, a move that could push the asset toward a new all-time high or bring it within close range. The last attempt to break through led to Bitcoin’s most recent high, but gains quickly reversed as sentiment weakened in the market.
