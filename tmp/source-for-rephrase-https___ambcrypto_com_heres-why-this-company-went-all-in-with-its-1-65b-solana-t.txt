Solana Here’s why this company went ALL IN with its $1.65B Solana Treasury play 2min Read Solana is pumping, and Forward’s massive PIPE deal just added to it!

With Solana’s price climbing, the market appears to be backing the bet. Forward Industries just made one of the boldest bets on crypto we’ve seen from a public company. The Nasdaq-listed firm closed a $1.65 billion private investment in a public equity (PIPE) deal to load up its corporate treasury with Solana [SOL]. Backed by heavyweights, the move puts Forward squarely in the spotlight now. Forward bets big on Solana Led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, the round saw over $300 million committed by the trio. This, alongside support from Bitwise, Borderless Capital, SkyBridge, and a slate of crypto founders and angels. The move will reshape Forward’s balance sheet, putting SOL at its core. To cement the strategy, Multicoin’s Kyle Samani is stepping in as Board Chairman, with Galaxy’s Chris Ferraro and Jump’s Saurabh Sharma joining in as observers. As expected, the market reaction was instant. In fact, the stock price spiked by 15% in pre-market trading before cooling down. Is it in elite company? A look at Solana’s biggest corporate holders highlighted the scale of Forward’s latest move.

Galaxy Digital sits on 1.35M SOL worth $320.9M, while smaller players like Mercurity Fintech and iSpecimen round out the list. In comparison, Forward’s $1.65 billion allocation will instantly place it well above these names – Making this one of the most aggressive Solana treasury plays to date.

On the price front, SOL rallied to $238, up by 4.2% on the day, with its RSI just below the overbought zone.

Finally, at press time, both spot and derivatives action revealed sustained appetite. This makes Forward’s $1.65 billion treasury bet look more like a calculated strike. If anything, the market may now be ready to back it. Subscribe to our must read daily newsletter Next: Bitcoin – Will BTC’s next rally hit $140K as miner behavior shifts?
