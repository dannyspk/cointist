Analysis XRP – Why a 20% upside is possible if THESE levels hold 2min Read XRP’s descending triangle breakout hints that a 20% rally is on the horizon.

XRP’s major liquidation levels are $2.988 on the lower side and $3.084 on the upper side. Bullish sentiment around Ripple [XRP] is heating up amid a market shift. In recent days, the asset has shown impressive performance and has successfully broken out of a bullish pattern, hinting that an XRP bull run could be on the horizon. XRP price action, key levels to watch At press time, XRP was trading at $3.05, marking a 1.67% gain over the past 24 hours. This price increase was accompanied by a 49% surge in trading volume compared to the previous day, indicating strong support from both investors and traders. The likely catalyst behind this heightened activity is a bullish breakout. According to AMBCrypto’s technical analysis, XRP has successfully broken above a long-standing descending trendline that had served as resistance since the 18th of July 2025. The breakout is confirmed by the daily candle closing above the trendline, signaling potential for continued upward momentum.

However, the $3.4 level appears to be a key point of interest for XRP, as it could halt the upside momentum. At present, the asset also needs to hold key levels like $2.93. If this level is breached, a sharp fall could occur to grab the available liquidity below the support level of $2.70. Technical indicator and expert bullish forecast At the time of writing, the Supertrend indicator was red and positioned above the asset’s price, signaling a prevailing downtrend and strong selling pressure. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continued to rise, reaching 57. Although this level suggests the asset is approaching overbought territory, there’s still room for further upward momentum before signs of exhaustion emerge. Looking at the current market sentiment, a well-followed crypto expert made a bold prediction. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the expert stated that if XRP breaks the $3.05 level, it could push the asset toward a target of $3.60, a move XRP has already achieved with its recent gains. On-chain data signal mixed sentiment Despite the bullish outlook, Binance’s XRP reserves appear to be continuously increasing, suggesting ongoing dumping and signaling a red flag for the asset. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that Binance’s reserve has surged by 43 million over the past week, precisely during the period when the asset has shown continuous upside momentum.

Over the past 24 hours, XRP’s major liquidation levels were at $2.988 and $3.084 on the lower and upper sides. At these levels, traders are over-leveraged, with $65.21 million worth of long positions and $24 million worth of short positions.
