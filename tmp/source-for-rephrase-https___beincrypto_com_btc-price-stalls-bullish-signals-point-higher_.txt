Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin currently hovers below a critical resistance level at $115,892 after two failed attempts to break higher in recent sessions. The stalled price action suggests a period of consolidation may be forming. However, on-chain indicators still flash signs of growing bullish momentum, hinting that a stronger rally remains on the horizon.

Interestingly, despite this short-term hesitation, on-chain data suggests market strength is still building.

When the number of these wallets climbs, it reflects rising retail and institutional interest and deeper network adoption, which could sustain a BTC price surge in the near term. Further strengthening the bullish outlook, data from CryptoQuant reveals that 93.6% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is currently in profit, a trend that has historically been followed by strong bullish phases.

At 93.6%, the analyst argued the trend points to strong optimism and sustained momentum. “The market is clearly in bull mode. This might scare those thinking “everyone’s in profit, time to run,” but I see it as a positive — it keeps the market’s excitement alive,” Crypto Avails stated. Break Above $115,892 Could Unlock $122,000 With on-chain activity heating up and profitability reaching levels previously followed by rallies, BTC might be gearing up for another climb. A decisive break above the $115,892 resistance could trigger a rally toward $119,367. If buy-side pressure strengthens here, BTC could extend its gains and rally to $122,190. BTC Price Analysis.
