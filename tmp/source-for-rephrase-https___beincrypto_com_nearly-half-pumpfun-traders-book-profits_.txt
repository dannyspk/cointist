On September 12, blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps, citing Dune Analytics data, reported that out of more than 270,000 wallets, roughly 130,000 addresses are in profit, while a slightly larger share remains underwater.Sponsored .divm, .divd {display: none;} @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {.divm {display: block;}}@media screen and (min-width: 769px) { .divd {display: block;}} Sponsored On-chain Data Reveals Sharp Divide in PUMP Traders’ Profits and Losses According to the firm, the numbers reveal how profits and losses diverge across different tiers of traders.

The uneven distribution of wins and losses comes as Pump.fun rolls out Project Ascend, a reform initiative launched in early September. A key feature of the upgrade, “Dynamic Fees,” lowers project costs as their market caps expand. This mechanism is designed to deter short-term rug pulls and other exploitative launches. By linking fees to market performance, Pump.fun is betting that stronger projects will thrive while low-quality scams become less attractive to deploy. The program has already distributed nearly $20 million to token creators and played a pivotal role in Pump.fun’s recent market ascension. Pump.Fun’s Creator Claims.

Data from BeInCrypto shows that PUMP, the platform’s native token, climbed more than 4% over the past 24 hours, rising from $0.0058 to $0.0064.
