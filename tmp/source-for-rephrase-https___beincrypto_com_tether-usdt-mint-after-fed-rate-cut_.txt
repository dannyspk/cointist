Tether has minted $5 billion in USDT within the past week, underscoring renewed demand for digital assets following the US Federal Reserveâ€™s latest interest-rate cut. On September 19, blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens revealed that the stablecoin issuer created another $1 billion in tokens on Ethereum.Sponsored Sponsored Tether Expands USDT Supply by $5 Billion in a Week This added to the $4 billion minted before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on September 17.

The move, which reduces borrowing costs, is often interpreted as a potential catalyst for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Market experts note that stablecoins like USDT typically benefit in such environments because they function both as a gateway into crypto markets and as a liquidity refuge during volatile periods. As a result, Tetherâ€™s rapid issuance during the week reflects more than a mere expansion, as it signals investor positioning ahead of shifting macroeconomic conditions. Meanwhile, the latest minting has altered the balance of stablecoin distribution across blockchains.Sponsored Sponsored Data from DeFiLlama shows Ethereum now hosts $81 billion worth of USDT, accounting for 45% of total circulation.

This distribution strengthens Tetherâ€™s dominance in the $292.6 billion stablecoin sector, where USDT alone represents nearly 59% of the market with $172 billion in supply. Unsurprisingly, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino touted USDTâ€™s accelerating adoption in the space.
