Amin Haqshanas 12 hours ago Crypto treasuries with long-term strategy will ‘survive any market’: Hashkey HashKey Capital CEO Deng Chao says crypto treasuries must be treated as strategic reserves, not speculative bets, to remain sustainable in volatile cycles. Listen 0:00 2934 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEEDThe survival of corporate crypto treasuries depends on governance and discipline, according to HashKey Capital CEO Deng Chao. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Chao argued that digital asset treasuries (DATs) are sustainable long-term, but “with an important caveat.” Those that lack risk frameworks, diversify poorly or treat digital assets like speculative bets tend to collapse in volatile cycles.“Resilience comes from discipline,” he said. “Digital assets themselves are not inherently unsustainable; it is how they are managed that makes the difference.”The remarks come just weeks after HashKey launched its $500 million DAT fund in Hong Kong. The fund targets Bitcoin- and Ethereum-based corporate treasuries and will actively deploy capital across onchain infrastructure, custody and ecosystem services.The fund is designed to serve institutions and corporations seeking operational use of digital assets. “Not only holding them but also benefiting from the growth of the underlying infrastructure,” he said.

In contrast, public companies hold 1,111,225 Bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets, worth $128 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.All entities holding Bitcoin.

HashKey’s DAT vehicle supports regular subscriptions and redemptions and includes exposure to both BTC and ETH to reduce concentration risk.“Treasuries that have entered crypto have long struggled with two issues: liquidity and operations,” Chao said. “Our DAT fund was built to solve these pain points.”HashKey plans to deploy capital across the Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) ecosystems, which Chao described as the dual anchors of liquidity and innovation in today’s crypto landscape. Priority sectors include custody, payments, staking services, and regulated stablecoin infrastructure.The fund’s scope is international. While it launched in Hong Kong, Chao confirmed HashKey is also targeting the US, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and the UK, noting that “the investment thesis of the fund is global from day one.”Related: Institutional demand grows with new crypto treasuries and SEC reforms: Finance RedefinedMisconceptions are barriers, says ChaoChao also addressed skepticism from traditional finance. Many institutional players still believe crypto is speculative, hard to secure, or incompatible with standard accounting. “These misconceptions are not just gaps in understanding, they are barriers to broader institutional adoption,” he added.Looking ahead, Chao said HashKey is especially bullish on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, institutional OTC markets and infrastructure for onchain financial products.“Tokenized products expand the investable universe,” he said. “OTC markets provide the channels for capital to flow at scale… This convergence signals a shift from fragmented crypto activity to a fully integrated digital finance ecosystem.”Magazine: Meet the Ethereum and Polkadot co-founder who wasn’t in Time Magazine#Bitcoin #Cryptocurrencies #Business #Ethereum #Cryptocurrency Investment #Ethereum ETF #Bitcoin ETF #ETF #Bitcoin Reserve Add reaction
