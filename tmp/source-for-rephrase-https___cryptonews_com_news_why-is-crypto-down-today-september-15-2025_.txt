But the structural backdrop ‚Äì falling rates, institutional positioning, and bullish derivatives markets ‚Äì suggests there‚Äôs still substantial upside ahead. This is likely not the cycle top.‚Äù 1/ I‚Äôve seen a lot of FUD that ‚Äúthe music is about to stop‚Äù. It is true, some nasty drawdowns may us in the next few weeks. However, I believe the market is bright for the rest of Q4.This is, by no means, ‚Äúit‚Äù for the bull cycle; there‚Äôs plenty of gas left in the tank. üßµ‚Äî Sean | Derive (@SeanNotShorn) September 14, 2025 On average, BTC returns -2.9% in September. This is largely due to natural selling pressure around the US financial year-end, Dawson explains. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already seeing signs of that pressure in the data. I‚Äôd argue we‚Äôre only halfway through what could be a very powerful Q4 rally.‚Äù 3/ii) Slowing DAT accumulation means a reduction in price momentum for ETH and BTC.DATs are in the mNAV business, they sell shares at an inflated mNAV to buy more crypto. As mNAV has been sliced in the last few weeks, the potential to drive prices has fallen as well. pic.twitter.com/ZOGNwzdDNX‚Äî Sean | Derive (@SeanNotShorn) September 14, 2025 Meanwhile, options markets are showing sustained bullish sentiment, Dawson continues. For BTC, open interest is stacked around $140,000, $150,000, $160,000. and $200,000 strikes for the 26 December expiry. Call open interest outnumbers puts nearly 2.5 to 1 (64K vs. 26K). For ETH, there‚Äôs a broad spread of bullish strikes from $4,000 to $7,000.‚ÄúThat positioning matters ‚Äì option boards let us derive the market‚Äôs consensus probability of price outcomes,‚Äù Dawson writes. ‚ÄúAnd right now, they‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a 40% chance ETH closes above $5,000 by year-end, and 20% chance it settles above $6,000. For BTC, the market gives a 37% probability of $125,000 or higher by the same time.‚ÄùLevels & Events to Watch NextAt the time of writing on Friday morning, BTC trades at $116,309. The price moved from the intraday low of $114,915 to the high of $116,689, before slightly correcting to the current point.Looking at the weekly prices, the range from $110,870 to $116,705, meaning that the coin is not far from the intraweek high.The price has been moving to test the $117,500 level.
