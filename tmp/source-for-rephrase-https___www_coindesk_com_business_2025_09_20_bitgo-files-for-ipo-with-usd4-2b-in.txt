BitGo generated $4.19 billion in revenue in the first six months of 2025, nearly quadrupling the $1.12 billion recorded in the same period a year earlier.

The firm now manages over $90 billion in cryptocurrency on its platform, from 1.14 million users.These figures, however, remain concentrated in mostly five cryptocurrencies. Per the filing: “The value of a majority of our AoP has been, and continues to be, concentrated in a few digital assets held by our clients, including Bitcoin, Sui, Solana, XRP, and Ethereum, which constitute 48.5%, 20.1%, 5.7%, 3.9%, and 3.0% of our AoP [Assets on Platform] as of June 30, 2025, respectively.”The S-1 also outlines a dual-class share structure, giving Class B shareholders, including co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe, 15 votes per share compared with one vote for Class A stock. That setup ensures Belshe will retain control after the offering, with BitGo qualifying as a “controlled company” under NYSE rules.BitGo said IPO proceeds would fund technology development, acquisitions, and stock-based compensation while boosting visibility and financial flexibility.The IPO follows public listing moves from other major companies in the cryptocurrency sector, including Circle, Gemini, and CoinDesk’s parent company Bullish.BitGoIPONew York Stock ExchangeMore For YouKevin Durant Recovers Bitcoin Bought at $650, Now Up Over 17,700%, After Nearly a DecadeBy Francisco Rodrigues, AI Boost|Edited by Aoyon Ashraf10 hours agoThe episode comes amid growing frustration among Coinbase users, many of whom alleged they’ve faced similar issues retrieving account access.What to know: NBA forward Kevin Durant had been locked out of his Coinbase account for nearly a decade, but has now regained access to his bitcoin holdings, which he purchased in 2016 at an estimated $650 per coin.Durant's bitcoin holdings have appreciated significantly, with the price of BTC rising over 17,700% since 2016, and are now valued at around $116,000 per coin.Read full storyLatest Crypto News Kalshi Outpaces Polymarket in Prediction Market Volume Amid Surge in U.S. Trading2 hours agoInternet Computer Bets Big on AI as Crypto Markets Play Catch-Up4 hours agoSolana’s Yakovenko Says Bitcoin Must Upgrade to Survive Quantum Threat by 20306 hours agoKevin Durant Recovers Bitcoin Bought at $650, Now Up Over 17,700%, After Nearly a Decade10 hours agoMichael Saylor: Bitcoin Is Building a Base as 'OG' Hodlers Exit and Big Money Preps11 hours agoBankrupt Exchange FTX Set to Repay $1.6B to Creditors Starting on Sep. 30Sep 19, 2025Top StoriesMichael Saylor: Bitcoin Is Building a Base as 'OG' Hodlers Exit and Big Money Preps11 hours agoKevin Durant Recovers Bitcoin Bought at $650, Now Up Over 17,700%, After Nearly a Decade10 hours agoBankrupt Exchange FTX Set to Repay $1.6B to Creditors Starting on Sep. 30Sep 19, 2025Crypto Gives Away Week's Gains in Friday DeclineSep 19, 2025Crypto ETF 'Floodgates' Open With SEC Listing Standards, But Price Impact May Be UnevenSep 19, 2025U.S. Treasury Takes Next Step in Turning GENIUS Act Into Stablecoin RegulationsSep 19, 2025AboutAbout UsMastheadCareersBlogInvestor RelationsContactContact UsAccessiblilityAdvertiseSitemapSystem statusNewsMarketsFinanceTechPolicyFocusVideosCoinDesk DailyEditors PicksShortsSpotlightPodcastsCoinDesk Podcast NetworkMarkets DailyGen CUnchained with Laura ShinThe Mining PodCryptocurrenciesPricesBitcoin (BTC)Ethereum (ETH)XRPSolana (SOL)DataTrade DataDeriviativesOrderBook DataOn-Chain DataAPIData CatalogueAI & Machine LearningIndicesMult-Asset IndicesReference RatesStrategies & ServicesInsights & AnnouncementsDocumentation & GovernanceEventsCoinDesk: Policy & RegulationConsensus Hong KongConsensus MiamiWebinarsSponsored Thought LeadershipPress ReleaseMEXCPhemexStellarResearchResearch ReportsEthicsPrivacyTerms of UseCookie SettingsDo Not Sell My InfoX icon© 2025 CoinDesk, Inc.Disclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.
