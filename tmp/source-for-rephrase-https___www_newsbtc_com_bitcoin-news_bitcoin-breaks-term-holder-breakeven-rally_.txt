Bitcoin (BTC) has surged from around $108,000 on September 1 to above $115,000 at the time of writing – recording a gain of roughly 4% over the past two weeks. However, fresh on-chain data suggests that Bitcoin may be on the cusp of a fresh rally that could propel it to new all-time highs (ATH). Bitcoin Rises Above Mid-Term Holders’ Realized Price According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, Bitcoin’s recent rebound from $107,000 to just above $114,000 has lifted the digital asset over the Realized Price of mid-term (3-6 months) holders.

It serves as a key pivot level, often acting as support or resistance that reflects sentiment and potential sell pressure from this cohort. var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6); var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd; var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER'; document.write('<scr'+'ipt src="'+absrc+'" type="text/javascript"></scr'+'ipt>'); if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement("script"); s.async = true; s.type = "text/javascript";s.src = "https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js";var n = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || []; var abkw = window.abkw || ""; var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0; (function(){ var divs = document.querySelectorAll(".plc366606:not([id])"); var div = divs[divs.length-1]; div.id = "placement_366606_"+plc366606; AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], "placement_366606_"+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: "servedbyadbutler.com", click:"CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER" }}); })(); Per analysis by ShayanMarkets, the mid-term holders’ Realized Price currently stands at around $114,000. Now that BTC has surged above this level, the likelihood of an immediate sell-off has reduced significantly. The analyst added: A firm breakout and hold above this level would confirm renewed confidence from mid-term holders, potentially serving as the launchpad for another bullish leg that could propel Bitcoin to new all-time highs. Conversely, failure to hold above $114K risks shifting sentiment back toward caution and opens the path to deeper corrective moves. A Bump On The Road For BTC Fellow CryptoQuant contributor Gaah brought attention to short-term holders’ (STH) Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), normalized with a 30-day moving average. The contributor noted that after four months of consistently operating above the break-even line, the indicator is now showing that STH are selling their holdings at a loss.

Although BTC has jumped from $60,000 to as high as $125,000 over the past year, the SOPR STH has recorded descending peaks. var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6); var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd; var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER'; document.write('<scr'+'ipt src="'+absrc+'" type="text/javascript"></scr'+'ipt>'); if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement("script"); s.async = true; s.type = "text/javascript";s.src = "https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js";var n = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || []; var abkw = window.abkw || ""; var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0; (function(){ var divs = document.querySelectorAll(".plc452518:not([id])"); var div = divs[divs.length-1]; div.id = "placement_452518_"+plc452518; AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], "placement_452518_"+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: "servedbyadbutler.com", click:"CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER" }}); })(); In past cycles, a sharp surge in price was usually accompanied by peaks in the Extreme Greed region, suggesting strong retail participation. However, the current market cycle did not see any such dynamic at play, hinting that the rise in price was likely sustained by institutional investors. Source: CryptoQuant Gaah added that historically, market tops have only been confirmed when SOPR STH levels reached levels of extreme greed, a development that has not yet occurred in the current rally. As a result, the long-term trend remains firm, and the current realization of losses may just be a temporary healthy pullback. That said, some analysts caution that Bitcoin may already be very close to hitting its peak for this market cycle. Others predict that BTC may slump in September, before it resumes its bullish trajectory in Q4 2025. var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6); var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd; var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER'; document.write('<scr'+'ipt src="'+absrc+'" type="text/javascript"></scr'+'ipt>'); if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement("script"); s.async = true; s.type = "text/javascript";s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';var n = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || []; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var plc452519 = window.plc452519 || 0; (function(){ var divs = document.querySelectorAll(".plc452519:not([id])"); var div = divs[divs.length-1]; div.id = "placement_452519_"+plc452519; AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452519, [728,90], 'placement_452519_'+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452519++, keywords: abkw, domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com', click:'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER' }}); })(); Still, some analysts forecast Bitcoin reaching as high as $150,000 by Christmas. At press time, BTC trades at $115,050, up 0.7% in the past 24 hours.
