Bitcoin (BTC) has reached a critical turning point, successfully flipping a key horizontal support zone that previously acted as resistance. With momentum now building, the focus has shifted to the next major test: the $117,000 resistance level. A decisive move above this threshold would not only confirm the continuation of the current rally but also set the stage for a potential run toward new highs. Daily Support Flip Confirms Bullish Control Alpha Crypto Signal, in a recent market update, pointed out that BTC is showing renewed strength on the daily timeframe. The leading cryptocurrency successfully flipped a key horizontal zone into support, a move that highlights growing buyer dominance in the market. This structural shift is seen as a positive development for bulls, laying the groundwork for further upside momentum.

This level has emerged as the next significant hurdle for bulls, acting as a critical area where market sentiment could either extend the rally or spark profit-taking. var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6); var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd; var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER'; document.write('<scr'+'ipt src="'+absrc+'" type="text/javascript"></scr'+'ipt>'); if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement("script"); s.async = true; s.type = "text/javascript";s.src = "https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js";var n = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || []; var abkw = window.abkw || ""; var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0; (function(){ var divs = document.querySelectorAll(".plc366606:not([id])"); var div = divs[divs.length-1]; div.id = "placement_366606_"+plc366606; AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], "placement_366606_"+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: "servedbyadbutler.com", click:"CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER" }}); })(); BTC bulls pushing price higher | Source: Chart from Alpha Crypto Signal on X The analysis further noted that if Bitcoin manages to push above $117,000, the level itself could turn into an attractive area for potential short setups. However, such a strategy carries risks, as the invalidation point would be a decisive breakout above BTC’s all-time high. Until then, $117,000 stands out as the key level of interest for market participants. How Bitcoin reacts in this zone will determine whether it consolidates, faces rejection, or surges higher. For traders, this level offers a critical point to evaluate possible entries, exits, and positioning as the next major move takes shape. Bitcoin Struggles To Secure A Hold Above $116,000 According to a recent post by Crypto VIP Signal, Bitcoin is continuing its upward trajectory. However, the cryptocurrency has not yet been able to firmly hold above the $116,000 level, which suggests that while the overall trend is bullish, buyers have yet to fully overcome this significant hurdle. var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6); var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd; var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER'; document.write('<scr'+'ipt src="'+absrc+'" type="text/javascript"></scr'+'ipt>'); if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement("script"); s.async = true; s.type = "text/javascript";s.src = "https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js";var n = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || []; var abkw = window.abkw || ""; var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0; (function(){ var divs = document.querySelectorAll(".plc452518:not([id])"); var div = divs[divs.length-1]; div.id = "placement_452518_"+plc452518; AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], "placement_452518_"+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: "servedbyadbutler.com", click:"CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER" }}); })(); Related Reading Bitcoin Price Recovery Hopes Rise – Can Bulls Push It Past Resistance? 1 week ago Crypto VIP Signal’s analysis notes that the entire market is looking positive, but a temporary slowdown can be expected. This is primarily attributed to a decline in trading volume, which is a common occurrence on weekends as activity from institutional traders and large investors often lessens. Given these conditions, Crypto VIP Signal predicts that Bitcoin will likely experience a period of sideways movement. The consolidation phase would allow the market to digest recent gains and build the necessary momentum to attempt another push past the $116,000 resistance.
