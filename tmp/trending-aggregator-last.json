    "summary": "Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, extended its rally on Thursday, jumping over 8% to trade near $58.77. The move comes after rebounding from its earlier record of $57.40 and places the token just shy of the crucial $60 psychological barrier. Related Reading: From $2 Trillion To $400T? CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More Driving this surge is the successful integration of USDC and Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP V2), now live on Hyperliquid’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The upgrade enhances liquidity and security across HyperCore and HyperEVM applications, facilitating faster and smoother deposits for DeFi users. Analysts suggest this milestone could attract institutional traders, boosting HYPE’s long-term adoption. Record Revenue Strengthens Investor Confidence Beyond price action, Hyperliquid’s fundamentals are equally impressive. According to Artemis Terminal, the network generated $2.5 million in fees in a single day, surpassing industry leaders like Ethereum and Solana. A Reflexivity Research report confirmed that Q3 was Hyperliquid’s strongest quarter yet, with total fees reaching $250.45 million, net income to token holders amounting to $243.59 million, and a team size of just 11 members. This lean but high-performing setup has fueled optimism that Hyperliquid can continue scaling without losing efficiency. Combined with staking incentives and growing exchange listings, many traders see HYPE as one of the most promising tokens in the current market. Hyperliquid (HYPE)’s Wedge Pattern Raises Caution Despite strong fundamentals, technical analysis suggests caution. On the two-hour chart, HYPE touched $59.36, testing the upper boundary of a rising wedge formation, a pattern often associated with weakening momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing overbought levels, with bearish divergence forming as price makes new highs without matching momentum. Analysts warn that a rejection at $59.36 could trigger pullbacks to $55 support, with deeper downside targets at $52–$48 if selling pressure builds. HYPE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: HYPEUSD on Tradingview However, if bulls defend support and confirm strength with a bullish engulfing candle, HYPE could rebound toward $60 and beyond, potentially aligning with Polymarket traders who forecast short-term moves toward $70. Related Reading: BNB Chain (BNB) Smashes $1,000 Milestone for the First Time Ever For now, the line in the sand remains at $59.36. Whether Hyperliquid breaks higher or faces a wedge breakdown will determine if HYPE’s new all-time high transforms into sustained momentum, or just a temporary peak.

    "summary": "Crypto analyst CryptoELITES has predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach $5, providing a bullish outlook for the foremost meme coin. The analyst also mentioned what needs to happen for DOGE to reach this ambitious price target.  Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally To $5 If This Happens In an X post, CryptoELITES stated that the target for the Dogecoin price is $5 after a DOGE ETF launches. The analyst opined that a huge wave of institutional money is about to flow into meme coins very soon, with this money coming through the ETFs. Notably, REX-Osprey is launching the first Dogecoin ETF today.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Eyes 1,250% Surge To $3.5 – Here’s The Roadmap The REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF will provide institutional investors with spot exposure to DOGE and could serve as a catalyst for a Dogecoin price rally to $5, as CryptoELITES predicts. New capital could flow into the DOGE ecosystem through this ETF, which would spark higher prices for the foremost meme coin.  Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that more Dogecoin ETFs could launch soon enough, especially with the SEC’s approval of generic listing standards, which help fast-track crypto ETF listings. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that DOGE is one of the crypto assets that has futures on Coinbase, which makes it eligible for faster listing under the SEC’s new rule.  Notably, Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares have filed for a DOGE ETF, and their respective funds could launch soon, which is bullish for the Dogecoin price. The launch of these other ETFs besides the REX-Osprey ETF means that more liquidity could flow into the meme coin’s ecosystem, although it remains to be seen if the $5 target is achieved.  Meanwhile, CryptoELITES had also previously predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach $5 from a technical analysis perspective. The analyst cited DOGE’s historical cycles and the gains it recorded previously as the reason why the meme coin could reach this target.  $10 DOGE Target Still In Place Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has again reiterated his $10 target for the Dogecoin price in this cycle. He believes that the meme coin can reach and surpass this target based on historical trends. He noted that each cycle’s first year (2013, 2017, and 2021) has historically delivered the strongest gains.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Just Broke A Regional High For The First Time This Year, Why A 300% Rally To $1 Is Possible The analyst noted that in the current cycle, the pattern suggests that the Dogecoin price could be in for substantial upside this year if history repeats, although the yearly candle hasn’t closed yet. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could even reach as high as $36 in this cycle. Meanwhile, DOGECAPITAL predicted that Dogecoin’s cycle could extend from the projected October cycle top if Bitcoin’s does.  At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.28, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "source": "newsbtc",
    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-to-invest-in-ethereum-eyes-5500-october/",
    "orig_url": null,
    "summary": "Ethereum ($ETH) is under the spotlight after Fundstrat’s Tom Lee reiterated his bullish stance, stating that $ETH could reach $5.5K by mid-October. He further added that both Bitcoin and Ethereum could make a ‘monster move’ in the next three months. Lee explained that the driver for this price rise will be the Federal Reserve&#8217;s expected monetary easing, including the 0.25% rate cut. He believes that this liquidity injection will primarily benefit Bitcoin and Ethereum, making them the biggest winners of the Fed&#8217;s new policy. Alongside $ETH, $XRP is also drawing attention, with the upcoming launch of the REX-Osprey $XRP ETF (under the ticker XRPR). Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, says XRPR will be a ‘litmus test’ of investor demand for traditional spot $XRP ETFs. As larger players compete for liquidity and institutional validation, new cryptocurrencies see this as the ideal opportunity to capture outsized gains as capital flows seek the next wave of growth. These developments also highlight why early opportunities in emerging projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) place them among the best crypto to invest in now. Ethereum’s $5.5K Ambition + XRP ETF Approval: Altcoin Gems Poised to Explode Next On September 17, 2025, the SEC approved rule changes that simplify the listing process for spot crypto ETFs, marking a significant regulatory milestone that opens the door for spot ETFs. Before this rule, every exchange had to file an individual 19b-4 rule change application for each new spot crypto ETF, resulting in long timelines and delays. This made matters more complicated for smaller players as issuers and exchanges needed legal teams and months of lobbying to get approvals. The new SEC rule paves the path for $XRP ETF approval, which was in regulatory limbo despite strong market demand. This development could accelerate institutional adoption, bring new liquidity into the $XRP market, and improve its long-term price trajectory. On the other hand, Fundstrat MD and Head of Technical Strategy Mark Newton’s bullish forecast of $ETH reaching $5.5K was absorbed by the market, alongside news of the SEC’s ETF rule change, which strengthened the positive momentum. Moreover, these developments lower barriers for retail on-ramps, reduce regulatory friction, and create opportunities for emerging altcoins like $BEST and $SUBBD – and OGs like $ETH – to shine. Read on to discover why these are the best crypto to invest in now. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Crypto Driving Global Wallet Domination Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the core power behind the Best Wallet app, a next-generation, multi-chain, non-custodial crypto hot wallet designed to dominate Web3 and beyond. As a utility token, $BEST offers an edge, giving real cost savings, presale access, and iGaming-fueled rewards all within the Best ecosystem. USPs of $BEST include: Reduced transaction fees across chains, directly improving PnL efficiency. Early whitelist entry to vetted presales and initial DEX offerings. Higher staking rewards through the upcoming staking aggregator. Governance rights, with votes on platform integrations and token listings. $BEST is currently priced at $0.025655, while the listing price has been set at $0.0225. So the presale gives early adopters a competitive edge. Our Best Wallet Token price prediction forecasts that $BEST could reach $0.035215 by the end of 2025, $0.05106 in 2026, and potentially as high as $0.07 by 2030, indicating strong long-term growth potential. If you invested $100 in $BEST today, it could grow to approximately $137.26 by the end of 2025 through price appreciation. When factoring in the token&#8217;s generous 83% staking APY, you could reap roughly $251.19, a 151% gain by year-end. The presale has already raised $15.9M+, with traction already proving a strong demand and high staking returns. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) offers one of the most attractive upside profiles among utility tokens this year. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Tapping Into The Content Creator Industry With An AI Edge $SUBBD powers an AI-driven Web3 content creator platform, providing fans with access to premium content, exclusive drops, and direct creator interactions. Considering the content creator economy could reach $480B by 2027, according to Goldman Sachs estimates, this gives $SUBBD the potential to be among the strongest plays of 2025. SUBBD is a platform for creators and fans alike, with attractive perks for both. As a creator, you’ll have access to an AI assistant for chats, scheduling, editing, and monetization. The ecosystem enables frictionless global payments in crypto and fiat, and cuts out the need for costly middlemen – like agents. The SUBBD platform, by the way, already has a 250M+ following. That means a lot of exposure for content creators. Meanwhile, as a fan, holding $SUBBD means AI-enhanced interactions, discounts, and access to exclusive content, as well as AI tools. You can also stake your tokens for 20% APY and unlock rewards, beta features, and more. That attractive blend of AI and content creation has seen $SUBBD raise $1.1M+ through its presale, with no signs of momentum slowing. $SUBBD’s current price is $0.05645, although the next price rise is expected in less than three days. Early adopters can also secure a fixed staking APY of 20% for the first year, after which staking transitions to a platform benefit model, rewarding active ecosystem participation. According to our $SUBBD Price Prediction guide, $SUBBD could reach $0.438 by the end of 2025, representing an upside of around 676% for early adopters. Looking ahead, the token might reach a high of $0.668 in 2026 (a gain of 1,083% from today&#8217;s presale price), while long-term projections suggest a potential peak of $0.57 in 2030, still more than 910% higher than current levels. If you invest $100 in $SUBBD today, that investment could grow to around $775.90 by the end of 2025 purely from price appreciation. Additionally, the 20% staking APY would yield an extra $20 in rewards, bringing the total to approximately $795.90. Learn how to buy SUBBD Token here. This combination of explosive growth potential, steady staking returns, and early-stage entry makes SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) one of the most compelling high-upside crypto opportunities in 2025. 3. Ethereum ($ETH) Eyes $5.5K Breakout – What’s Driving the Surge? Currently trading at around $4.5K, Ethereum ($ETH) is predicted to reach $5.5K by mid-October. Analysts attribute the price drive to rising institutional inflows, increased ETF demand, technical breakouts, and a high percentage of $ETH supply being staked. $ETH’s trading volume has shot up by 27% in the past 24 hours, reaching $47.6B, and its market cap is up by 1.6%, reaching $552B. CoinMarketCap users are also considering an upside of $4.7K to $4.8K for Ethereum, if it holds at $4.5K. BlackRock buying $25.4M Ethereum is also fueling a potential market rally for $ETH, and we’re likely to see more upside in the near future. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors like the Fed rate cuts, regulatory clarity, and accelerating stablecoin adoption could add to the bullish momentum. Together, these factors could fuel ETH&#8217;s march towards its $5.5K milestone within weeks, making it one of the top cryptos to invest in now. Buy your $ETH on Binance and other leading exchanges, while $BEST and $SUBBD can be bought from their official websites. This isn’t financial advice. The cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile. Always do your own research before making any investments. Authored by Aaron Walker, NewsBTC – www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-to-invest-in-ethereum-eyes-5500-october &#160;",

    "orig_url": null,
    "summary": "Solana is once again in the spotlight after surging past the $240 level, marking a strong recovery and renewed momentum for the altcoin. Bulls appear firmly in control, but analysts caution that the next critical resistance lies at $270, a level that must be reclaimed before Solana can realistically attempt to retest its all-time high. The move underscores the growing confidence in SOL as one of the leading players in the market, particularly as institutional activity adds fuel to the rally. Related Reading: Solana Sees Institutional Accumulation: 413,075 SOL Moved Off Exchanges In Hours Fresh data from Lookonchain highlights this trend, revealing that institutions continue to accumulate SOL, signaling sustained confidence in the token’s long-term potential. This influx of capital aligns with broader bullish sentiment across the market, where traders are increasingly positioning for higher valuations. Beyond technicals, fundamentals also support Solana’s rally. The network continues to post strong activity levels, with robust developer engagement and rising usage in areas such as DeFi, NFTs, and real-world applications. Together, these factors suggest that SOL could extend its momentum in the coming weeks. Institutions Double Down on Solana Accumulation Solana continues to attract institutional attention, reinforcing its position as one of the leading assets in the crypto market. According to Lookonchain, FalconX executed another massive withdrawal just four hours ago, moving 118,190 SOL (worth $28.39 million) from Binance. This follows an even larger transfer reported yesterday, when the same institution withdrew $98 million worth of SOL from multiple exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Coinbase, and Bybit. The back-to-back moves underscore the rising confidence of institutional players who appear to be positioning themselves ahead of what many expect could be a new expansion phase for the market. Such consistent accumulation adds strong support to Solana’s price outlook. Investors often interpret large institutional withdrawals from exchanges as a signal of long-term conviction, since assets moved off centralized platforms are typically intended for custody or staking rather than immediate resale. With Solana already trading above $240 and bulls eyeing the critical $270 resistance level, these developments strengthen the case for further upside momentum. The timing is also crucial. The Federal Reserve’s recent 25bps rate cut has shifted market sentiment, propelling risk assets into a new phase of optimism. With liquidity flowing back into the system and institutional players aggressively accumulating, Solana could emerge as one of the top beneficiaries of this renewed bullish environment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Signals Bullish Edge As Traders Eye Fed Pivot Technical Details: Testing Key Level The weekly chart of Solana (SOL) shows strong bullish momentum, with the price now trading at $246.69, up nearly 3% in the last session. This move extends a rally that began in early August, pushing SOL above its key moving averages. The 50-week SMA ($180.40) and the 100-week SMA ($154.05) are both trending upward, providing a solid base of support. The long-term 200-week SMA ($101.71) remains well below current levels, highlighting the strength of Solana’s multi-month uptrend. What stands out is Solana’s attempt to reclaim levels last seen in late 2021, when it reached its all-time high above $260–$270. Currently, SOL is testing resistance in this critical zone. A successful breakout above $270 could pave the way for another retest of all-time highs near $300–$320, while failure to hold momentum here may result in a pullback toward the $200–$210 support region. Related Reading: BNB Chain (BNB) Smashes $1,000 Milestone for the First Time Ever Institutional accumulation, as reported recently, continues to provide bullish tailwinds. Combined with improving macro sentiment after the Fed’s rate cut, Solana’s technicals suggest that bulls remain firmly in control. However, traders should remain cautious of potential profit-taking at these elevated levels, given the significance of historical resistance in this area.

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve’s first rate cut of 2025 has landed—25 basis points on September 17—and, in Trader Mayne’s telling, that removes the last macro “X-factor” hanging over the crypto market. In a video analysis posted the same day, the veteran price-action trader argued that with the policy move now in the rear-view mirror, crypto can “just focus on the charts,” sketching a roadmap in which Bitcoin posts one more leg higher into new all-time highs before a pullback ushers in a classic altseason blow-off. “We had FOMC today and the rates got cut finally… It’s 25 basis points,” he said. “Now the market’s going to digest it.” Where Is Bitcoin Price Going Next? The policy backdrop he’s reacting to is straightforward: the FOMC lowered the fed funds target range by a quarter point to 4.00%–4.25% on Sept. 17, with Chair Jerome Powell describing the move as a risk-management response to weakening labor dynamics and leaving the door open to additional easing this year. The decision drew an 11–1 vote, with newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran dissenting in favor of a larger, 50 bps cut—an unusually hawkish dissent in a dovish direction—while the Board’s implementation note reset key administered rates effective Sept. 18. Markets read the statement and projections as signaling scope for further cuts into year-end. Related Reading: Crucial Ten Days Ahead For Crypto: Will They Ignite Mega Altcoin Season? From here, Mayne’s framework is unapologetically technical. He characterizes Bitcoin’s most recent upswing as corrective relative to the prior impulse and expects price to “push above the mid-range” toward a range high around $120,000–$121,000, where he will watch for rejection at a higher-time-frame confluence defined by a weekly swing-failure pattern (SFP) and an H12 breaker. If momentum stalls there, he plans to short into a washout to clear out built-up leverage—“HYPE made another all-time high today. PUMP has tripled in the last two weeks… there’s some leverage in the system”—and then buy the dip for what he calls the last parabolic leg of the cycle. “Any sort of dip on BTC, I want to be looking for a long,” he said, adding that a shallow retest in the $110,000–$111,000 area or a deeper sweep of recent lows would both be acceptable springboards if the rebound is decisive. If, instead, price grinds through the $120,000 s with no signs of exhaustion, Mayne says he has “no problem” flipping to breakout longs above the all-time high once strength is confirmed intraday—an approach that mirrors his playbook from prior expansions (“Once this thing broke out aggressively… you’re looking for longs”). He emphasizes sequence over prediction: the short he’s eyeing is counter-trend—“a pullback in an uptrend”—and the prime objective remains to position for the next impulsive advance. When Will The Crypto Market Top? Timing-wise, he situates the prospective cycle top in Q4 2025 or Q1 2026, describing a pattern in which Bitcoin’s final vertical leg into the $150,000 to $180,000 region is followed by distribution while altcoins reprice higher—the archetypal altseason. “This parabolic leg I think would be the last leg of the bull run,” he said, before outlining notional alt targets consistent with a late-cycle melt-up: Ethereum $5,000–$7,000, Solana $300–$500, Dogecoin $0.50–$0.70. The mechanics, as he narrates them: a last BTC push, a corrective wash, a V-shaped reclaim of the 2024 ATH “very quickly,” then Q4 “mania” with breadth shifting to large-cap alts as Bitcoin distributes. Related Reading: December 2024 Crypto Crash Signal Returns As Altcoins Go Wild The technical scaffolding behind that view leans on concepts familiar to discretionary price-action traders. Weekly SFPs (failed breaks of prior extremes) set the trap line at range edges; H12 breakers and order blocks frame high-probability reaction zones; and fair-value gaps guide where liquidity vacuums might fill during a corrective flush. On structure, he insists the weekly trend remains up, so any short is tactical and any deeper dip must resolve in a swift V-bottom and reclaim of the former highs to keep the cyclical script intact. His invalidation is equally clear: “If we spend any significant time back below [the 2024 all-time high], it’s really bad… I’m probably going to reassess my thoughts.” Macro, in Mayne’s view, now recedes to the background. The rate cut may have helped pull forward some September strength—“you could argue… the up move we’ve seen on Bitcoin… is in anticipation of this rate cut”—but with the decision made and Powell hinting there “could be another one… there could be two,” his emphasis is squarely on execution: wait for price to trade into the $120,000s and signal weakness for the clean counter-trend short; or, absent weakness, wait for the breakout continuation and ride it. Either way, he’s explicit about the north star for the coming weeks: “Focus on Bitcoin… Any sort of dip on BTC, I want to be looking for a long… Then altseason.” At press time, BTC traded at $117,176.

    "summary": "Jack Mallers, co-founder and CEO of Twenty One Capital, told NYSE TV that he expects Bitcoin to climb much higher from current levels. Related Reading: FalconX Moves 413K Solana Worth $98M – Impact On SOL Price According to Mallers, the size of global wealth available for savings gives Bitcoin room to grow in a big way. He made the bold remark that Bitcoin could be “100 to 200 times from here,” and his firm’s buying behavior appears to follow that view. Analyst&#8217;s 200x Bitcoin Claim According to Mallers, total global wealth across assets like stocks, property, gold and art is about $900 trillion. He argued roughly $400–500 trillion of that is used mainly as savings. &#160; Right now, Mallers said, Bitcoin’s market value sits near $2 trillion. At the price cited in reports — about $115,570 per coin — he sees a path for dramatic expansion if Bitcoin captures only a slice of that savings market. Jack Mallers says, “#Bitcoin will 200x from here.” &#8220;Bitcoin is going after a $400-500 trillion market, and it&#8217;s only $2 trillion.&#8221; pic.twitter.com/urpR8HelFO — Maestro (@GoMaestroOrg) September 16, 2025 Twenty One Capital’s Buying Strategy Reports have disclosed that since April, Twenty One Capital has acquired 43,514 BTC, a haul worth roughly $5 billion at current prices. The firm has backing from players such as Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank, and it plans to merge with SPAC Cantor Equity Partners to pursue a public listing. Mallers’ team has been buying aggressively, and the stash already exceeded the firm’s initial target by about 1,500 BTC. How Other Big Names See Bitcoin Several high-profile figures have also made bullish calls, and their forecasts are often cited alongside Mallers’ views. According to public remarks, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has suggested Bitcoin could reach $700,000. Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge has said he expects Bitcoin to hit about $200,000 by the end of 2025. Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra Global, has outlined a base-case of $350,000 and a more aggressive scenario as high as $700,000. These estimates differ in timing and method, but they share a common theme: large upside is possible if demand and adoption keep rising. Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Rally Yet? Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025 Where Twenty One Capital Fits In Based on reports, Mallers’ firm is joining a larger group of companies that hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Michael Saylor’s Strategy has accumulated 638,985 BTC — a figure that dwarfs most other corporate treasuries and is valued near $74 billion. Mining companies such as MARA Holdings hold about 52,477 BTC. One important contrast is funding approach: Strategy leaned on debt to build its position, while Twenty One Capital has avoided that route so far. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView",

    "summary": "Ethereum is approaching a decisive phase that could carry it into five-figure territory, according to a multi-timeframe analysis from trader Cantonese Cat (@Cantonmeow). Ethereum Ready To Smash All-Time Highs In a video published today, the analyst argues that ETH has cleared a cluster of late-cycle resistances and is now exhibiting a confluence of technical signals—on monthly, weekly, daily, and intraday charts—that “favor some of the higher targets to be met, maybe 1.272, 1.414, 1.618, anywhere around potentially five figures.” These Fib levels would put ETH at $7,752, $9,883 and $14,011 respectively. On the monthly chart, the analyst centers his case on the log-scale Fibonacci structure and volatility regime. ETH, he says, spent months stalling around the 0.886 retracement near $4,000—the same zone that repeatedly repelled the market in prior attempts—but “last month, we had the break through that here, convincingly.” Related Reading: Ethereum Rally Stalls As Spot And Perpetual Volumes Flatten On Binance He notes that the wick of the latest push already poked above the wick from the November 2021 peak, reinforcing the idea that supply at the former top is thinning. Simultaneously, the monthly Bollinger Bands are expanding while price “is impulsively going to the upside here along with the upper Bollinger Band,” a backdrop he describes as consistent with trend acceleration rather than mean reversion. “It does favor some of the higher targets to be met,” he said, while stressing sequencing: “We need to kind of break above the previous all-time high here first before we can actually talk about moving further up.” A second pillar of the bullish thesis is the Ichimoku profile across cycles—specifically the fusion of Tenkan-sen (conversion line) and Kijun-sen (base line). “When you have the Tenkan and Kijin fused together and price is riding up along with it, this fusion over here is called Katana,” he explained. Historically, he said, this “precipitates a big move,” and with price now above the Katana, “the Katana is shooting the price up.” On the current structure: “We got a Katana here being built up and price is currently impulsively going to the upside, so that is also favorable for Ethereum.” On the weekly timeframe, Cantonese Cat frames ETH’s advance through a three-cycle template defined by a “cycle liquidity zone” acting as a pivot. Each prior cycle saw deviations above and below a governing trend line before a sustained move once the zone was recaptured. He places the present consolidation directly on that blueprint: after breaking the “$4,000 liquidity level,” ETH is “consoling sideways… trying to find some energy before breaking up higher.” A back-test is possible but not required, he said; the “primary case” remains continuation unless the chart invalidates. Lower Timeframe Signals The lower timeframes, in his view, are already aligning with that outcome. On the daily chart, he highlights a developing “Adam and Eve continuation pattern” nested within a classic cup-and-handle, where “the handle… volume is not that great,” which he views as textbook, followed by “a pretty decent volume bullish engulfing candle.” Measured against log-scale retracements, price was rejected at 0.786, found support at 0.5, and is now “trying to break through 0.6… work our way back… to 0.786,” a rhythm he says “is being respected pretty decently.” He also points to a short-term bottoming sequence—“you can see something called a tweezer bottom… if you have anywhere around two or three of these kind of wick sticking down like that, that’s usually a pretty decent bottom”—and a three-candle “morning star” reversal: “It’s a reversal pattern and it could end up leading to a reversal here… seems to be working out pretty well.” Related Reading: Citi’s Ethereum Forecast: No New All-Time High Expected, Year-End Target At $4,300 On the 12-hour chart, he reads the structure as reaccumulation in a Wyckoff sense, referencing the “rounded bottom,” a strengthening secondary test—“the ST is higher than the VCLX”—and the emergence of a “creek” overhead that price appears ready to vault. “It does look like a reaccumulation type pattern… showing some strength… consolidating sideways… to reaccumulate before [a] bullish continuation,” he said, adding that after the prior vertical leg, digestion at elevated levels is constructive. Relative-strength diagnostics, he argues, reinforce the ETH-led narrative. Ethereum’s market-share gauge (ETH.D) “has broken above the Ichimoku cloud… with strength,” then “back-tested the cloud for about four weeks,” and may be waiting for the Tenkan to “rise… as support” before the next leg. On a monthly volatility basis, he adds, “the 20-month moving average was reclaimed… and we simply spent a month here back-testing” it—evidence that dominance could trend higher if the back-test holds. “That’s basically meaning that Ethereum wants to continue to outperform the rest of the cryptocurrency market here for [the] foreseeable future,” he said. Breadth indicators outside of ETH also tilt risk-on in his framework. The Total3 index (total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) is “trying to break above and form an all-time high” on a monthly “cup and handle” structure, while the “Others” index (market cap excluding the top 10 coins) has punched through the 0.786 level on the weekly and is “gravitat[ing]… to the next level, the 0.886.” He emphasizes the distinction between log and linear retracements, noting a failed linear 0.886 breakout in a prior attempt: “If we were to break above the linear, as well as the log 0.886 here with style, then I think Others would end up performing extremely well and would end up following the footsteps of Ethereum.” His conclusion is unambiguous: “I am bullish on Ethereum. I’m bullish on altcoin. I’m bullish on the cryptocurrency market space in general.” At press time, ETH traded at $4,565. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
